<small>KEEPING UNCLE BEN&#8217;S APPOINTMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;We are ready to start, but where are the
twins?&#8221; exclaimed Jinks impatiently. Jinks was
Meredith Starr&#8217;s chum who lived next door to
the Starrs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they were here but a moment ago!&#8221;
said Mete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they ran on to Mossy Glen without
us,&#8221; came from Lavinia Starr, two years older
than the twins, who were eight.</p>

<p>A shrill whistle from the woods then told the
three waiting children that Don and Dot Starr
were half-way to the meeting place. The Blue
Birds and Bobolinks were going to meet at the
barn, known now as the Publishing Offices, to
start thence for the ten-forty train to New York.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;Hurry up, we&#8217;ve wasted three minutes waiting
for those awful twins!&#8221; sighed Vene&mdash;the
nickname for Lavinia.</p>

<p>At the Publishing Offices on the Mossy Glen
estate, the three late arrivals found all the members
assembled. Ruth and Ned Talmage had
not far to walk as their home was at Mossy
Glen, and the Starr children including Jinks were
now accounted for. Besides these two groups,
there were the other girl-members of the Blue
Bird Club, or Nest, and the boys who founded
the society called Bobolinks, that published the
magazine and other important printed matter&mdash;such
as tickets, notices, programmes, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here come Ike and Jim&mdash;can we all crowd
into those two autos, do you think?&#8221; asked Ned,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be the first time they&#8217;ve carried
such a load,&#8221; laughed Jinks.</p>

<p>Just as the children climbed eagerly into the
two cars, Mrs. Talmage appeared hurrying along
the path from the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Ned&mdash;remember! Don&#8217;t allow anyone
to go other than the way I&#8217;ve directed you. This
is the first time that we grown-ups consented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
to have you children go to New York alone, and
you must be careful to follow all advices from
us,&#8221; declared Mrs. Talmage, with a note of
anxiety in her tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll be all right, mother; don&#8217;t worry.
Aren&#8217;t Mete and Jinks and I almost grown up?&#8221;
said Ned, soothingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not! You three boys are just as
full of mischief as Don Starr, and everyone
knows what we have to endure from <i>him</i>!&#8221;
sighed Mrs. Talmage.</p>

<p>The children all laughed&mdash;Dot Starr the twin,
laughing loudest, but Don looked as dark as
a thunder-cloud at his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess you all got out of bed with a left foot,
this morning! That accounts for the grouches!&#8221;
grumbled Don.</p>

<p>Another laugh failed to bring harmony into
Don&#8217;s discordant heart just then, so Mrs. Talmage
turned again to Ned:</p>

<p>&#8220;When you get off the train at Hoboken, you
take the tube uptown&mdash;remember now, uptown!
Don&#8217;t get on the cars that go to Newark or Cortlandt
Street. Ask a guard which is the right
train to carry you to 23rd Street.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;Then walk across from the 23rd Street exit
to Fourth Avenue, and up Fourth to Uncle Ben&#8217;s
address. You have it written on the letter, Ned,
so you simply can&#8217;t go wrong!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t go wrong, Mother. You only <i>think</i>
we may!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, for goodness&#8217; sake&mdash;hurry up! We&#8217;ll
miss that train,&#8221; complained Don, who now had
an opportunity to give vent to his ire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, children! I wish you would telephone
me as soon as you arrive at Uncle Ben&#8217;s
offices, so I will know you are all right!&#8221; said
Mrs. Talmage as the cars rolled away.</p>

<p>The party had ample time to board the train
at the little station of Oakdale, and soon they
found themselves in Hoboken&mdash;the terminal for
the Jersey suburban trains.</p>

<p>As they were passing the news-stand at the
foot of the steps that led to the tubes under the
river, Don saw a variety of tempting candies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got my week&#8217;s allowance with me, Dot&mdash;do
you want some chewing-gum?&#8221; asked her
twin.</p>

<p>&#8220;S-sh! They&#8217;ll hear you! And you know Vene
won&#8217;t let us have chewing-gum,&#8221; warned Dot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
glancing at the other children. But they had not
heard Don, as they were interested in buying
the tickets to New York.</p>

<p>This was a perplexing matter, as tickets for
Dot, Don, and Tuck Stevens were to be at half-price,
and those of the other children at full-price.
The twins took advantage of the problem
to buy a box of gum and a roll of chocolate disks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Looka here! We&#8217;ve got ten pieces of
gum for a nickel!&#8221; chuckled Don, delightedly, as
he emptied the box into his palm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You take five and I&#8217;ll take five,&#8221; suggested
Dot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no! Didn&#8217;t I pay for them? You take
one and when you want another I&#8217;ll give it to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I always go even shares with you when <i>I</i>
get anything at home,&#8221; argued Dot.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s different! You don&#8217;t pay out your
hard-earned money for it, and I had to. Why,
just think how many times last week I had to be
at school on time! Didn&#8217;t that mean getting out
of bed so early that I &#8217;most got insomnia from
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dot had an inspiration. She hastily began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
chewing the single piece of white-candied gum
and determined to ask for a second piece soon,
as Don had promised to give her another one
when she wanted it.</p>

<p>Don now hastened in front of his sister, to
join the other children, but he was too preoccupied
with the gum to notice where he went. He
heard a guard call: &#8220;All aboard!&#8221; and he
rushed in dragging Dot after him&mdash;just in time!
The door was closed and away sped the train.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Ned&mdash;and Jinks, and the others?&#8221;
gasped Dot, the moment they found themselves
safe on the moving train.</p>

<p>Don could not reply. He seemed to have a
great obstruction in his mouth. Finally he
shoved the obstacle over in the hollow of a cheek
and gurgled out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess they went in the car ahead to be nearer
the exit gate when we get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don Starr! What have you got in your
mouth?&#8221; demanded Dot, suspecting the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gum, of course! What have you got?&#8221; retorted
Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got <i>one</i> piece! How many have you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got what I paid for!&#8221; snapped Don, but
he had the grace to blush at his selfishness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I just wish you&#8217;d swallow it! So there!&#8221;
cried Dot, who had unwisely thrown away the
gum she had, to induce her twin to give her a
new piece.</p>

<p>Don glared only&mdash;he could not speak comfortably.
Dot was so offended that she started to
walk through the forward car in search of her
friends. &#8220;Where&#8217;er yeh goin&#8217;, Missy?&#8221; asked
a guard, stopping her.</p>

<p>&#8220;To find the others. They must be in front,&#8221;
said Dot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got your ticket? I didn&#8217;t see you drop one in
the box back yonder, cuz I was watchin&#8217; the two
of yuh,&#8221; was the astonishing reply from the
guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ticket! Don, have you got a ticket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;Ned got all of them,&#8221; replied Don, but
he was so hasty in moving the gum out of his
tongue&#8217;s way to permit him to speak, that it almost
slipped down his throat.</p>

<p>A tremendous coughing and choking spell
caught Don, and his face turned as red as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
poppy, while Dot hammered his back exultantly&mdash;now
she had a chance to get even with him!</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;er yeh goin&#8217;&mdash;Jersey City?&#8221; now
asked the guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jersey City! Why&mdash;no. We are to get off at
23rd Street,&#8221; explained Dot, surprised for the
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a Newark train,&#8221; announced the
guard, wondering what he could do with two
stray children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my goodness! Maybe Ned isn&#8217;t on this
train. Was there another train in the same station?&#8221;
gasped Dot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure&mdash;one on either side of the platform,
but we&#8217;re always hollerin&#8217; out where we go so
folks won&#8217;t get mixed,&#8221; returned the guard.</p>

<p>Don couldn&#8217;t allow Dot to take the lead in this
exciting adventure, but he could not speak with
his mouth full, so he slyly dropped the gum in
one palm and held his hand in his pocket. Then
he was free to take his part.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is the nearest stop to 23rd Street?&#8221;
asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we will now stop at the Erie Station;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
next is Jersey City, and so on till we reach
Newark. Why?&#8221; replied the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking we could get off and take some
car back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll have to do anyway, &#8217;cause
you haven&#8217;t any ticket to show. But I don&#8217;t see
how you are goin&#8217; to ride back again widdout
payin&#8217; at all!&#8221; explained the man.</p>

<p>Then a light seemed to break in upon them at
the same time! They caught hold of the guard&#8217;s
coat and laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see! Ned had all the money and
tickets, so he dropped them for us when he went
through the gateway!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And diden&#8217; you&#8217;se spend your ticket money
for candy?&#8221; asked the guard, suspiciously, as he
knew the weakness of youngsters, having a
brood at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cross my heart, we didn&#8217;t! I used my week&#8217;s
spending money. Last week I didn&#8217;t earn any
cuz I owed it all!&#8221; said Don, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;All out for Erie Railroad!&#8221; now yelled the
guard, as the train pulled in and it was his duty
to open the doors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Git off here and wait fer a train what comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
in on th&#8217; other side the platform!&#8221; called he, shoving
Don and Dot out from blocking the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged! Good-by!&#8221; called Don, about
to wave his hand that had been hidden in his
pocket. The other hand grasped Dot&#8217;s sleeve.</p>

<p>The door slammed, the train moved out, and
the twins were left standing alone. Don found
he could not withdraw his hand readily, and discovered
that the gum had not only stuck fast to
his fingers but had also clutched a hold on various
articles a boy always carries in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dot you go and ask the newspaper man how
long before a New York car comes in?&#8221; suggested
Don, as he wished to be alone when that
gum came forth.</p>

<p>Dot, proud to be trusted by her brother with
such an important mission, ran away and Don
hurriedly set to work. After much tugging the
gum came out and with it came a marble, a
broken jackknife, a fish-hook, a brass button, a
sling-shot, and a few other treasures.</p>

<p>Don did his best to extricate his personal property
from the gum without wasting too much of
the rare treat. So he carefully chewed off every
bit that clung to each article as he pulled it forth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
He replaced the treasures in his pocket and
thrust the gum in his mouth just as Dot came
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;See that red sign&mdash;up there?&#8221; said she, pointing
to an electric sign overhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that reads where the trains go. This
one just coming in is uptown the man said.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that she dragged her twin aboard without
ceremony&mdash;was he not chewing that gum
again, and did she have any? No, sir!</p>

<p>Dot refused to speak a word to Don as they
were whisked along to the Hoboken terminal.
Here they jumped off and stood and looked about
anxiously for their friends. Not a child was to
be seen besides themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they go back to the train to find us?&#8221;
asked Dot.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they got on the New York cars and
thought we were on, too. When they get to
23rd Street they&#8217;ll miss us and wait there till
we come,&#8221; explained Don, taking the gum from
his mouth again to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get on the first train for uptown,&#8221; replied
Don.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s one&mdash;I&#8217;m going to ask the man
where it goes,&#8221; announced Dot, running to a
guard standing by his platform.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you go?&#8221; asked the little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Downtown, New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; and Dot walked away.</p>

<p>Another string of cars pulled in, and other
guards got off after the passengers had left.
Dot ran up to one and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jersey City, Manhattan Junction, Harrison,
and Newark!&#8221; called the man, without paying
any attention to the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess that isn&#8217;t it, yet,&#8221; thought Dot, giving
the man a scornful look because he would not
notice her.</p>

<p>The twins waited and waited, and then another
train came in where the downtown train
had pulled out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&mdash;Read the sign in the windows!
&#8216;Uptown New York,&#8217; Dot!&#8221; cried Don, crowding
on before anyone could get in ahead of him.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Don walked into a car
without waiting for Dot, and she, being small,
was pushed back by the grown-ups till the last.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
Just as she was about to step on, Jinks caught her
skirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank goodness! Here you are! We&#8217;ve all
been hunting high and low for the two of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;where did you come from?&#8221; questioned
Dot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just came in on that car over there&mdash;I saw
you waiting, before my train stopped, and tried
to hurry out to prevent you from leaving us.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, Dot stepped back beside Jinks,
and the guard shut the door and pulled the signal
cord. Instantly the train moved and carried
Don uptown alone. He had not seen Jinks and
thought Dot was behind him as he walked
through the sections looking for his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;There now! Don is gone!&#8221; cried Dot,
stamping her foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;On that car!&#8221; gasped Jinks, trying hard to
choke back a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and now he&#8217;ll get losted, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if he gets out at 23rd! We left Vene
there to grab you if you reached that far,&#8221; explained
Jinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Ned and Mete, and the others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ned went to Cortlandt Street and agreed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
meet me at Hoboken again. Mete went to Jersey
City and other stations to ask for you. We
left Ruth with the other Blue Birds and Bobolinks
in care of Vene at 23rd Street station.
Here comes a downtown train.&#8221;</p>

<p>It stopped and Ned stepped off. He glowered
at Dot and asked: &#8220;What under the sun do you
twins think we are, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nuthin&#8217; much, if you can&#8217;t take charge of a
few children!&#8221; retorted Dot, glowering as darkly
as he.</p>

<p>Jinks burst out laughing. &#8220;No use feeling
upset about it, Ned. No one yet has been able
to scold the twins!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another train now pulled in and Mete got off.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d just like to know what right you trouble-makers
had to leave us and wander around by
yourselves?&#8221; demanded he, angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t wander&mdash;we rode! And what&#8217;s
more you just got off the same kind of train we
got on, so you went the same route!&#8221; exclaimed
Dot, scornfully.</p>

<p>Now the train from uptown came in on its
last stop at Hoboken. Off stepped Vene. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
hurried over to join her friends with the exclamation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I saw Don on the train, but he didn&#8217;t get
off at 23rd Street where I waited. Before I
could call or get his attention, the cars moved
on. I waited but he didn&#8217;t come back and I don&#8217;t
know what to do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you come here for?&#8221; demanded
Mete, impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you would be here and could tell me
what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and most likely, by the time we all get
back to 23rd Street, those other nuisances will
have escaped! Then we&#8217;ll waste a whole day
in hunting them up, instead of visiting Uncle
Ben on time!&#8221; cried Mete, beside himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! I left them sitting in a row on the
bench with a colored porter to guard them. I
promised him some money if he would keep them
right where they sat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine! I tell you boys&mdash;Vene is a true suffrage
girl! She uses her wits as well as we men
do!&#8221; exclaimed Jinks, approvingly, for he was
Lavinia&#8217;s chief admirer those days.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;Pooh! If she was your sister you wouldn&#8217;t
think so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All aboard&mdash;uptown train!&#8221; now bawled a
guard, and all else was forgotten in the scurry
to get on.</p>

<p>Dot felt worried about her twin, but being
in such disgrace already, she did not add to her
troubles by asking for Don.</p>

<p>Soon the guard announced &#8220;23rd Street&#8221; and
the children trooped off. There sat the members
of the Blue Birds and Bobolinks in a row on a
bench, and a negro man standing beside them
was apparently enjoying himself, as he listened
to an orator standing at one end of the long
bench. It was Don who held forth with such a
flow of rhetoric.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say you, Don Starr! How came you here?&#8221;
shouted half a dozen voices, as as many individuals
ran over and caught hold of the boy.</p>

<p>At the sudden shaking, Don dropped something.
Dot saw it fall and gave it a vicious kick.
It was a huge ball of gum. Don saw it and
knew what had caused it to roll away. He glared
at Dot, and then turned to the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mighty good thing I got my wits about me!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
You boys aren&#8217;t worth a cent to look after a
bunch of youngsters! <i>I</i> know how to travel, all
right! I&#8217;ve been to Jersey City, Hoboken, Erie,
and Christopher Street, Ninth Street, Fourteenth
Street, Eighteenth, Twenty-third, Twenty-eighth
and Thirty-third Streets, all in an hour&mdash;and
here I am as fresh as ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fresh&mdash;of course you are! And I&#8217;m going
to have Uncle Ben take a lot of it out of you just
as soon as we get to his office!&#8221; threatened Mete.</p>

<p>&#8220;No you won&#8217;t either! I telephoned him from
the 33rd Street station to ask him what to do and
he said: &#8216;Go and wait at 23rd Street station as
planned, and bring them all over here as soon
as possible. You are almost an hour late for the
appointment!&#8217; so I am to take charge now, and
see that we all get over to the office as quickly
as you can travel!&#8221;</p>

<p>The children laughed at the order from Don,
and then started up the steps to the street, but
did not see Don stoop to catch up the ball of
gum. He planned to wash it well at a drinking
place he knew of in his uncle&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>Without further mishap, they all reached the
18th floor where Uncle Ben&#8217;s office was located,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
and Don slipped away. The gum was soon
washed, and he chewed as noisily as ever as he
ran after the last one to enter the door leading
from the main hall to the offices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don Starr! what are you chewing?&#8221; demanded
Vene, in a disgusted tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nawthin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are, too! Ned, see what he&#8217;s chewing!
I just know it&#8217;s gum!&#8221; from shocked Vene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don, are you chewing gum?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not chewing a thing&mdash;can&#8217;t you see my
jaws are as quiet as yours&mdash;quieter, cuz you&#8217;re
talking!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Were</i> you chewing gum?&#8221; now came severely
from Mete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that you noticed it!&#8221; said Don, saucily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open that mouth of yours!&#8221; demanded Mete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t&mdash;my tooth is hooked!&#8221; replied Don, a
faint twinkle beginning to wrinkle his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll yank the tooth out&mdash;open your mouth!&#8221;
and Mete caught hold of his younger brother&#8217;s
shoulders and shook him.</p>

<p>A choking, a sputtering, and a great confusion
followed as Don was forced to give up the gum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;you! you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but Vene had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
words to convey her horror at the untruth she
felt Don had told.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious&mdash;what a chunk! How could
you crowd it in at one time!&#8221; gasped Mete, when
he saw the size of the gum.</p>

<p>&#8220;He chewed nine pieces at once!&#8221; eagerly attested
Dot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you chew the tenth?&#8221; was the unexpected
query from Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the teeniest bit&mdash;just to get the flavor,
then I threw it away!&#8221; admitted Dot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, really!&#8221; from several voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;And she got angry when I wouldn&#8217;t give her
five even!&#8221; added Don, scowling at everyone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you say you couldn&#8217;t open your
mouth &#8217;cause your tooth was fast? Didn&#8217;t you
know you were fibbing?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say one word that was a lie! Now
you think! My tooth <i>was</i> hooked. I had to use
that gum to keep my tooth from getting cold and
aching again. The dentist told me always to
keep the nerve covered when I went outdoors.
He said it was an exposed nerve that made a
tooth jump. So I did as he advised me, that&#8217;s
all!&#8221; explained Don.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Not another word was said about the gum
then, as the inner door to Uncle Ben&#8217;s offices
was reached and the Publishers went in where
all was quiet, and such a thing as gum was never
thought of!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>WHO&#8217;S GOING TO HAPPY HILLS?</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Finn&mdash;where&#8217;er yeh goin&#8217; in sech a
hurry?&#8221; asked a newsboy of a pal who was hurrying
past.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;hello, Skelly! I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; fer that chap
what knows about them passes fer camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hully chee, Finn! Yeh don&#8217;t tell me ye&#8217;re
goin&#8217; to that Sunday School place&mdash;what?&#8221;
jeered the boy called Skelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t a prayer-meetin&#8217; camp, neider! It&#8217;s a
regerler camp fer boys and gals. I was told
there&#8217;s not a bit of Sunday School stunts goin&#8217;
on there,&#8221; replied Finn, defensively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh, all the same, you&#8217;ll come back actin&#8217;
like a little lady! Dey&#8217;ll cure yuh of cigarettes,
matchin&#8217; pennies and all the udder fun we&#8217;ve
had,&#8221; scorned Skelly, bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, now! I ain&#8217;t wantin&#8217; the ticket fer
meself&mdash;it&#8217;s only fer my sick sister, yuh know.
The Doc said she&#8217;d got to git out of that hot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
dark room in the tenement, and where kin I
keep her&mdash;on&#8217;y in a camp like this is?&#8221; explained
the worried brother to the leader of the Ludlow
Street gang.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; returned Skelly, apologetically,
&#8220;An&#8217; so yeh want to find Ike who&#8217;s got the address
of the place!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it! Have yeh seen him this mornin&#8217;?&#8221;
asked Finn.</p>

<p>&#8220;He went uptown to see the man at the printin&#8217;
office. He tol&#8217; me all the tickets he had on
hand were given out and he needed more. Why
don&#8217;t yuh trot up and see the man yourself instead
of hangin&#8217; &#8217;round waitin&#8217; fer Ike?&#8221; ventured
Skelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I will&mdash;where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Skelly thereupon dug down into the pockets
of a ragged pair of trousers and finally brought
to view a dirty scrap of paper. Upon it was
scrawled: &#8220;Benjamin Talmage, Manager of
Blue Bird Camp at Happy Hills, 354 Fourth
Avenue, New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s up near 23rd Street, yuh know,&#8221; Skelly
added, as Finn read aloud the address.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll git a hitch on a truck goin&#8217; up, and try to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
see the boss right away,&#8221; said Finn, his face expressing
relief at having some tangible plan to
act upon.</p>

<p>Thanks and the verbal expression of gratitude
were unknown to the street Arabs of New
York, but Skelly knew from Finn&#8217;s face that he
appreciated the information, and that was all
that was required of a friend.</p>

<p>A large auto-truck sped past the boys, and
Finn was soon perched on the tailboard, waving
his old cap at Skelly. The truck turned in at
23rd Street to go its way to the East Side, so
Finn jumped off and scanned the numbers of the
tall office buildings as he started uptown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah! Here it is! Hully chee, what a swell
shanty!&#8221; said he to himself as he stood wondering
whether to enter the tiled hall. Would the
elevator starter permit a boy so ragged and dirty
to go up in one of those shiny lifts?</p>

<p>He still pondered this momentous question
when Ike ran out and almost into him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looka where yer goin&#8217;, why don&#8217;che?&#8221; grumbled
Finn, then seeing that it was Ike, he clapped
him soundly on the back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;Aw, I say, Ikey! Gim&#8217;me a ticket fer me
sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out what&#8217;che crackin&#8217;, Finny! Dat&#8217;s
my back lung what sounds so holler when you
beat it,&#8221; grinned Ike, the good-natured boy from
Rivington Street who had won fame as a ticket-distributor
for Happy Hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got one to spare?&#8221; anxiously continued Finn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope! Yeh got&#8217;ta apply personal. I&#8217;ll go up
wid yeh if you wants one bad,&#8221; offered Ike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along den&mdash;I need yeh to help talk;&#8221;
so the two were soon going up.</p>

<p>After leaving the elevator, the two boys
walked down a very long corridor with offices on
either side. Said Ikey:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you&#8217;se wants to be careful how you&#8217;se
talk in here, see? Mr. Ta&#8217;mage is a fine chentlman
and don&#8217;t like no slang. Mebbe yeh better
keep yer mouth shet altogether an&#8217; let me do the
talkin&#8217;&mdash;cuz, yeh know, Finn, yeh do spill an awful
lot of slang widger English!&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn was properly impressed and consented
to have Ikey do all the talking. By this time the
boys reached the door leading to the suite of
offices they sought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;Please, ma&#8217;am, tell Mr. Ta&#8217;mage Ikey Einstein
is back yet&mdash;Micky Finn, too, wants to make
his acquaintance,&#8221; said Ikey to the pretty telephone
operator who sat near the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yank off yer cap, Finn&mdash;hurry up quick, before
she sees it!&#8221; hissed Ikey in his companion&#8217;s
ear as they stood waiting for an answer. Ikey
had removed his apology for a hat when entering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Talmage says will you be seated, he&#8217;ll
be out in a moment,&#8221; announced the girl, with a
smile at the young visitors.</p>

<p>Ikey knew the particular bench meant for waiting
callers, and silently led Finn to it. No sooner
were they seated than the door by which they
had just entered was flung open and a number
of children of their own age came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Miss Johnson! Uncle Ben in?&#8221; called
the youngest boy in the group.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s busy now, and has two waiting to see
him,&#8221; was the young lady&#8217;s reply after she had
acknowledged Don&#8217;s greeting&mdash;for the boy was
our old friend and favorite, Don Starr, and his
companions were no less than the officers of
the Blue Bird and Bobolink Publishing Society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
that issued the monthly magazine for Little Citizens.</p>

<p>At the nod of Miss Johnson&#8217;s head in the direction
of the two who were waiting, Don spun
around and recognized one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, if this isn&#8217;t our friend Ikey!&#8221; said
Don, in his tone and manners for all the world
like a grown man, as he caught Ikey&#8217;s hand and
shook it heartily.</p>

<p>The other children&mdash;Ned and Ruth Talmage,
Meredith, Jinks, Lavinia, and Dot Starr, turned
at Don&#8217;s words to watch the two boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where under the sun did Don meet that
boy?&#8221; whispered Lavinia to her brother Meredith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Vene, where does Don find anything he
wants to get hold of!&#8221; returned Meredith, chuckling
at his younger brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know!&#8221; now declared Dot Starr, Don&#8217;s twin
sister.</p>

<p>The others waited for her to explain, so she
placed a hand at the side of her mouth to prevent
the two strange boys from hearing what
she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are newsboys who first heard of us at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
the &#8216;Tree of Light&#8217; last Christmas. Ikey is the
thin one and he was at that Easter Egg Picnic
in Van Cortlandt Park, too. That&#8217;s where Don
met him; Ikey had such a lot of eggs that we
asked where he got all of them, &#8217;cause we knew
he couldn&#8217;t have had that many to start with.
And he told&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S-sh! Not so loud, Dot! He&#8217;ll hear you.
What did he tell you?&#8221; interpolated Jinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you know he works in a newspaper
printing place where they hire boys to clean
up messes of inks and trash, and run errands,
too. Ikey got a lot of free tickets from the
printer to some lecture and he traded them in,
a ticket for every egg he could get. Then he
told Don he was going to sell those eggs downtown
to his friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he?&#8221; asked Ruth, surprised that anyone
would want to sell Easter Eggs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over and find out&mdash;I guess that&#8217;s
what Don is talking about now,&#8221; replied Dot,
joining her twin brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Dot, Ikey just told me he made 56 cents
on those Easter eggs, and now he&#8217;s set up in
business&mdash;newspaper business of his own. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
wants me to go in as his partner&mdash;what do you
think of it?&#8221; said Don in a low voice, for fear his
brother or Jinks might overhear the plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! You couldn&#8217;t leave Oakdale for a
newspaper business, and what&#8217;s the good of having
a business if you can&#8217;t look after it yourself?&#8221;
replied Dot.</p>

<p>&#8220;He could yust invest his money an&#8217; I&#8217;d look
after it,&#8221; hurriedly explained Ikey, all for business.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Don looked after all he ought to at home,
he&#8217;d have more interests than he could take care
of. No sir! You leave Ikey Einstein to manage
his own investment!&#8221; decided Dot, the practical.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re jealous &#8217;cause you were left out&mdash;that&#8217;s
what!&#8221; said Don, impatiently, as Dot
pulled him back to his friends.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben came out just then, and shook
hands with his Oakdale friends. &#8220;Just go in
that director&#8217;s room until I finish talking to
these two young men, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>So the little Talmages and Starrs and Jinks
left Uncle Ben with Ikey and Micky Finn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ta&#8217;mage, dis newspaper boy&#8217;s got a bad-off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
sister to which a Doc says she must get away
quick to the country fer fresh air or a grave.
Now Finn&mdash;he&#8217;s Micky Finn, you know, an&#8217; a
fren&#8217; of mine&mdash;says he ain&#8217;t got no country place
an&#8217; neider have we got a cemetery lot if Nelly
goes and dies, but mebbe you kin let her come
right away, quick, to Happy Hills so she kin
get well and not need a grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ikey told the story in one breath so that at the
last he was not very distinct, but Uncle Ben knew
the story&mdash;there were so many, many more just
like it in the city! If only Happy Hills had fifty
times the number of acres fitted up with fifty
times the number of camp-nests!</p>

<p>&#8220;Micky, how old is your sister Nelly?&#8221; asked
Mr. Talmage.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s two years younger&#8217;n me,&#8221; stammered
Finn.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how old are you, little man?&#8221; continued
Uncle Ben, placing a friendly hand on the urchin&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>The touch and tone made Micky Finn brace
his backbone with conscious pride as he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mos&#8217; twelve, sur, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve been the bread-winner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
fer th&#8217; fam&#8217;ly fer four years&mdash;ain&#8217;t I,
Ikey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure he has! An&#8217; Nelly gits more&#8217;n lots of
sick gals we know, &#8217;cuz Finn won&#8217;t play craps
ner match pennies like the udder boys do!&#8221;
bragged Ikey, anxious to win a ticket for Micky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let me see! Who will go with Nelly,
to take care of her? Have you any other sisters
or family to travel with her?&#8221; asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had a sister two years older&#8217;n us but she
disappeared one night an&#8217; we never hearn tell
of her agin. She worked in a tobacco-shop.
Since then, I had all the supportin&#8217; to do. That
was last summer, she went wid anudder gal to
Coney Island an&#8217; never got back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to write down your address, Finn,
and send a lady down to see Nelly. If everything
is all right, she will arrange to take your
sister to the country at once. I&#8217;ll make out the
ticket myself. Now you can go out and spend
week-ends with her if you like. And should you
take a summer vacation, you can go to Happy
Hills free of cost for two weeks,&#8221; explained Mr.
Talmage.</p>

<p>Micky Finn was so overwhelmed with gratitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
and surprise at this unexpected invitation
that he stood gaping at his benefactor, but said
not a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;T&#8217;ank the chentleman, Micky! Can&#8217;t che
t&#8217;ank him nice, fer what he&#8217;s gone and done fer
you an&#8217; Nelly?&#8221; Ikey said with a scowl at his
friend for whom he was sponsor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do thank&mdash;Aw, get out, Ikey! De gentleman
<i>knows</i> the choky way I feel in my windpipe!
Don&#8217;che, Mister?&#8221; wailed Finn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Micky, I know just how you feel, and I
feel just as happy as if you had thanked me with
every word known to convey the feeling of gratitude,&#8221;
said Mr. Talmage, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s all right to say to him, Mr. Ta&#8217;mage,
but I don&#8217;t like my fren&#8217;s what I bring up here
to do nuttin&#8217; what ain&#8217;t all jus&#8217; right. We all
gotta remember to say what folks like you&#8217;se
say to each udder, ef we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to live at Happy
Hills!&#8221; rebuked Ikey Einstein, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, too, Ikey, but you have had
more opportunities to practice than Micky had;
when he meets us often, he, too, will begin to
change his habits and ways of expressing himself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>As Mr. Talmage spoke, Micky Finn recalled
the words his pal Skelly had said a short time
before: something about becoming a little lady
with fine manners but no fun!</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious, Uncle Ben&mdash;aren&#8217;t you most
done talking to those boys?&#8221; called Don Starr
from the door of the director&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming right now, Don! Well, Micky, let
me know when you want to go and spend Sunday
with your sister. I&#8217;ll try and get her off in a
day or two,&#8221; said Mr. Talmage. Then the two
street waifs took their departure.</p>

<p>Of course, you know what it is all about, don&#8217;t
you? You remember what Uncle Ben did in the
last Blue Bird book, and how the camps at
Happy Hills progressed so that they might be
ready to receive Little Citizens as early as the
last of May?</p>

<p>If you have forgotten how the Nests and other
plans at Aunt Selina&#8217;s country place were to be
built, I will repeat the description.</p>

<p>The great estate and farm of Happy Hills in
the Valley of Delight, had a fine large woodland
tract where the Nests were built. A shallow
brook ran through the woods, offering all sorts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
of fun and convenience to the little campers. At
one side of the woodland lay a fertile stretch
of land that was divided into many squares, one
for each child at camp, to be used as farms. In
this soil, a Little Citizen might dig and plant
and harvest different kinds of vegetables and
flowers and have them all for his own. No one
could trespass or take away what a child planted
on his or her own farm.</p>

<p>The Nests were large enough to hold six bunks
and a bed. The bunks, three on either side of the
square room, were to be for the six Little Citizens
occupying that Nest, and the bed at the
end would be for the Mother Bird of that particular
Nest. Besides the bunks and bed, there
was a locker and a clothes-tree at the head of
each bunk. The lockers had lids to be closed
and locked to hold personal things belonging to
the child who was given that section of the Nest.
It could also be used as a seat.</p>

<p>Each Nest was about fifteen feet square, and
posts held up a sloping roof to shed the rain.
This roof extended about two feet over the outer
line of the square room to protect the beds and
lockers from the rain when it stormed. Another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
arrangement to keep the inside of the Nest dry,
was a canvas curtain that rolled up on spring-rollers
in fair weather, but came down in wet or
cold weather, to act as a wall or screen. These
curtains buttoned down the sides and at the bottom.</p>

<p>A gallery three feet wide extended about the
outside of the Nest. This narrow veranda was
railed in safely by a three-foot fence to keep
the children from falling off the platform of the
Nest which was raised a few feet above the
ground.</p>

<p>The Refectory was a large open building
equipped with rain-proof curtains also, but on
fair days they were rolled up so that it was like
a great pavilion. Even the long tables and
chairs folded up and could be quickly stacked
up at one end of the room if the space was
wanted for games or meetings.</p>

<p>Besides the sleeping Nests and the Refectory,
there were a tool-house, a carpenter shop for
teaching carpentry, a machine-shop to teach mechanics,
a library with books and papers to read,
and in fact many other departments for the education
of boys and girls.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>As you read in the last chapter of &#8220;The Blue
Birds&#8217; Uncle Ben,&#8221; the children published their
June number of the magazine and planned to
suspend for July and August. In this June issue
they showed photographs of Happy Hills and the
Nests ready to receive tenants for the summer.
And as every benevolent institution and child&#8217;s
hospital, as well as the Welfare Workers and
physicians known to be interested in the poor
children received a copy of the June magazine,
the boys and girls publishing it felt sure there
would be plenty of applicants to fill the camp.</p>

<p>So work went on until the last of May, when
all was ready at Happy Hills, and Maggie Owens&mdash;you
remember Maggie, don&#8217;t you?&mdash;already
had her little flock of brothers and sisters in one
of the Nests. She was the first Little Citizen
to take up residence at the camp. Maggie had
been admitted without a ticket as her case was
well known to the Blue Birds and needed no investigation,
but the tickets were ready for distribution
the day before Decoration Day and
Uncle Ben was truly surprised at the demand
awaiting them.</p>

<p>Ikey Einstein had been suggested by the Big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Brother&#8217;s Organization as an honest, shrewd
little fellow who could be of great assistance in
the matter of tickets, so the boy was interviewed
and engaged at a salary to furnish information
about any of the numerous applicants from the
East Side, where Ikey lived.</p>

<p>And that is why Micky Finn sought out Ikey
when he wanted to secure a camp-ticket for
Nelly.</p>

<small>UNCLE BEN&#8217;S DRILL CORPS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Little Nelly Finn had been admitted to the
camp at Happy Hills, and was the happiest little
girl there. Never had she seen such grass and
flowers, to say nothing of the big trees and noisy
brook in the Valley of Delight. The day she had
stood with a lady, and several other children
waiting for the train that left at noon for Happy
Hills, Micky promised her to save his pennies
and come for a visit to the Camp that Summer.
Not only Micky, but Ikey, Skelly, and another
boy, who had a shoe-shine box, agreed to visit
Happy Hills.</p>

<p>Nelly was established in the Nest next to Maggie,
the Little Mother of six younger children&mdash;Maggie
was eleven. Because of her motherly
instincts, Maggie felt a grown-up interest in
the newcomers, who were about Nelly&#8217;s age.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you don&#8217;t know what to do wid dese
girls, Miss Martin,&#8221; said Maggie, the afternoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
of the new arrivals, as the Mother Wings of
that particular Nest seemed bewildered and worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is all new to me, little girl, and I am
only here until a school-teacher can take my
place,&#8221; replied Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Maggie,&#8221; suggested the Little
Mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know my name?&#8221; queried the
lady, curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heer&#8217;n Miss Selina&mdash;she&#8217;s our Flutey Bird,
you know what owns this place&mdash;tell Uncle Ben
that six more little gals was comin&#8217; wid a Miss
Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you can tell me where to find Uncle
Ben now?&#8221; asked the city lady eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m! He&#8217;s beginnin&#8217; a drill fer the boys.
They has to grow to be fine scouts, brave policemen,
and extry-brave firemen. You see we&#8217;se
goin&#8217; to have a regerler city-run camp here, and
Uncle Ben says boys must know how to proteck
folks and guard us against fires and udder bad
t&#8217;ings,&#8221; explained Maggie.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine! Where is the drill to take place?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Maybe we can all go and watch them,&#8221; said Miss
Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;We kin! I was just washin&#8217; Freddy&#8217;s han&#8217;s
to take him wid me&mdash;he&#8217;s too little to leave behind,
yeh see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Martin&#8217;s little flock of six understood
<i>that</i> part of life, for had not each one of them
been scrubbed and polished with brown soap and
coarse rags just before leaving the city?</p>

<p>Freddy was soon cleansed from the results of
making mud-pies near the brook, and Maggie triumphantly
led the way to the large green clearing
where the drill was to take place. On the
way she pointed out other Nests and explained
who occupied them, then she showed Miss Martin
the hospital, or clinic, as Maggie called it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dis Nest next to yourn is goin&#8217; to have some
blind kids in it, from the asylum up in the Bronx.
Miss Flutey tol&#8217; me not one of &#8217;em ever saw
anyt&#8217;ing on de outside world. She said all dey
coul&#8217; see was what was inside dere minds&mdash;do
you b&#8217;lieve dat?&#8221; asked Maggie, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, Maggie. Blind folks have no idea
of the exterior world and so picture it for themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
in their thoughts&mdash;that is anyone who has
been born blind and never saw material things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see!&#8221; murmured Maggie, slowly comprehending.</p>

<p>Then passing the next Nest, she continued
explaining:</p>

<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s where the boys are campin&#8217; just now.
All the Nests fer the boys ain&#8217;t done yet, and
most of dem have to live up in de row where
all dat noise is comin&#8217; from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How old are the boys already here?&#8221; asked
Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Half of &#8217;em are cripples er sickly lookin&#8217; kids
what was in a asylum er hospital, so dat&#8217;s why
dey ain&#8217;t runnin&#8217; aroun&#8217; playin&#8217; ball er diggin&#8217;
farms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After the drill I&#8217;d like you to show us the
farms,&#8221; suggested the lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;I&#8217;ll show you anyt&#8217;ing you likes
to see,&#8221; replied Maggie, graciously, but eyeing
the six little strangers to see how they took her
importance.</p>

<p>They now reached a rustic bridge spanning the
shallow creek, and Nelly stopped to watch the
fascinating ripples flow past under her feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;Oh looka! Looka&mdash;Miss Martin! Dere&#8217;s a
fish!&#8221; screeched Nelly, excitedly pointing at some
tiny minnows darting about.</p>

<p>The others crowded close to the railing to follow
the direction of Nelly&#8217;s pointing finger, and
great interest was manifested in the unusual
sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! One of the bigger boys <i>caught</i> a fish
yistiddy! A real live fish, it was, an&#8217; he said it
was swimming in the big crick what comes from
dis little one,&#8221; bragged Maggie, proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caught a real fish!&#8221; gasped the group of
astonished city waifs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep! And lemme tell you&#8217;se somet&#8217;ing else!
Dere are <i>reel</i> berries a-growin&#8217; on bushes over
on dat hillside!&#8221; and Maggie pointed at a sunny
slope a short distance from the camp grove.</p>

<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; chorused most of the little girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; birds, an&#8217; bumblebees, an&#8217; snakes, an&#8217;&mdash;oh,
heaps of awful stinger things what you&#8217;se
have to run from er jump over!&#8221; warned Maggie
with awesome tones and rolling eyes to impress
her hearers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Snakes won&#8217;t sting, Maggie, unless you tease
them. And even then there are many snakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
quite harmless. As for a bumblebee! The big,
clumsy fellow is as good-natured as a puppy,&#8221;
said Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Miss Martin, you knows an awful lot
of stuff, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; exclaimed Maggie, admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to, Maggie, as I am three times your
age. Maybe you will know more than I do, when
you grow up to be my age,&#8221; replied the lady,
smiling at the earnest little face.</p>

<p>All during this walk, the other children had
been silent, as they were not yet quite at ease.
All was so new and interesting that they had no
words with which to express their feelings, but
Maggie had been a Little Citizen almost two
weeks, now, and so felt qualified to act as official
guide to newcomers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe Miss Marting will tell us somet&#8217;in&#8217;
about a bee er a snake?&#8221; ventured Katy Kronen,
a little girl of eight.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we get back to the Nest I will tell you
all about some snakes I have seen, and about
the bees, too,&#8221; promised the Mother Wings, as
they reached the open field where outdoor games
and drills were to take place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;Dere he is&mdash;ain&#8217;t he grand?&#8221; cried Maggie,
excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;where?&#8221; asked several voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our Uncle Ben&mdash;he&#8217;s really de Uncle to
some kids what live in Oakdale. Dey made up
dis camp, and Miss Selina what&#8217;s got a heap of
money is lookin&#8217; after us an&#8217; payin&#8217; de bills.
Uncle Ben is her nephew, but everyone calls him
Uncle Ben, &#8217;stead of Mr. Ta&#8217;mage, an&#8217; he says
he likes to have so many nieces an&#8217; nephews,&#8221;
explained Maggie all in one breath.</p>

<p>Miss Martin now had her first glance at the
man she had heard so much of&mdash;not only in the
Welfare work but also from the papers at the
time of the Christmas Tree and Easter Picnic
in New York.</p>

<p>She saw a tall well-built man with the happiest,
cheeriest face she had ever seen. No wonder
everyone liked him so!</p>

<p>Maggie waved a hand energetically to attract
his attention, and soon the man smiled and waved
his hat at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dere now&mdash;he&#8217;ll come over pritty soon,&#8221;
sighed Maggie, with sublime faith in her prophecy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>And sure enough! As soon as Uncle Ben had
taken down the names of the boys who were to
enter a squad of Camp Police, he came over to
welcome the lady he had not yet met.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dis is my neighbor Mudder Wings, Uncle
Ben,&#8221; said Maggie by way of introduction.</p>

<p>The two smiled and felt much more at ease
because of such an informal introduction than
if it had been given by a diplomat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard of your educational work with
the city children,&#8221; said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have? Why I had no idea it was important
enough to be remembered by such a busy
man as you are known to be,&#8221; commented Miss
Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is most important to all who are sincerely
interested in the welfare of our future citizens,
because the work you are doing educates and
familiarizes the children with Nature, so that
they will grow kind and affectionate towards
things that used to inspire fear and cruelty. I
trust we will be able to keep you here this summer
to conduct a series of Nature talks for the
Little Citizens?&#8221; said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like nothing better, Mr. Talmage, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
I do not have to make my usual summer tour of
camps for the purpose of creating an interest
in Nature Study. I sent a few substitutes to try
the work this year and so I may not have to go
personally,&#8221; rejoined Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope you may remain with us. We
have a great work to accomplish here, Miss Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can see that. How I should love to
be connected with such a plan, where money is
no object, but the welfare of Little Citizens
is the main idea. Now let me see what you
plan to do this afternoon with the boys. I heard
it was a drill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am just organizing a staff of helpers
to look after the general good of those at camp.
Won&#8217;t you come over and stand under the shade
of the trees while I give the boys their first
lesson?&#8221; said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>So Miss Martin and her little companions followed
Mr. Talmage across the grass to the shady
spot he had designated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now boys! Attention! I shall open this
first drill by giving you some good rules to guide
your life in camp, and later, the Blue Birds and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Bobolinks are going to distribute cards which
they are now printing with these same rules and
regulations.</p>

<p>&#8220;First and foremost: You cannot repay the
kind people and children who made this lovely
country camp possible for you in a better way
than to show kindness and thoughtfulness to
everyone you meet. And when you go back to
the city, to take with you the rule of doing unto
others as you would be done by. If this Golden
Rule is obeyed the world will be a happy place
for everyone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every day, and every hour, you will find
ways to show your gratitude to Miss Selina for
this camp. It may be that a child is frightened
at something&mdash;you can comfort and encourage
it. Maybe a boys&#8217; quarrel or fight is on&mdash;you
can separate them and make peace. It is more
than likely that someone will use slang or swear
words, or call names or use improper English!
You can correct them in a thoughtful way that
will not be resented, but appreciated.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Guide for Little Citizens&#8217; that we publish
in the little magazine each month, ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
be well known by most of you now&mdash;how many
here have had a copy of the magazine?&#8221;</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the hands went up and Uncle
Ben nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, for the benefit of the few who have not
had a copy of our fine little monthly, I will explain:</p>

<p>&#8220;Our general motto is &#8216;Do something for
Somebody.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our seven Nest Resolutions are as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A Little Citizen makes himself useful to
others and is loyal to all friends, relatives, or
foes, in thought and deed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A Little Citizen loves his Country and resolves
to be a good citizen. He loves everything
in the land or sea&mdash;beast, bird, fish, or insect,
and will not injure or tease them.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A Little Citizen loves and protects the trees,
the flowers, and other growing things in Nature&#8217;s
creation.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A Little Citizen will care for all beautiful
things: books, pictures, clothing, and everything
useful, ornamental, instructive or entertaining.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A Little Citizen will refrain from discourtesy
of any sort; from using vulgar language or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
being disobedient. In following these ideals each
one will soon see the great improvement in all.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A Little Citizen resolves to daily seek opportunity
to accomplish some good thing&mdash;something
that will add to his character-building and
do good to others.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A Little Citizen will help where help is
needed, encourage the unhappy and hopeless, and
be true to others as he would be true to his own
best self.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;If everyone will remember these rules and use
them wherever possible, you will find what a
happy camp this will be for each one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I want to speak of my firemen&mdash;a squad
of the older boys who can be our official firemen
for the summer camp. For this work I have
chosen the ten boys who are standing at the left,
over there. Come forward, firemen, and let me
introduce you to the Little Citizens of Happy
Hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten strong boys ranging from nine to twelve
years of age now came over to Uncle Ben&#8217;s side
and stood eager to hear what he would have to
say to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all, I want to tell you&mdash;and then have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
you tell and teach the campers at Happy Hills&mdash;that
most of the fires that destroy life and property
are not due to accident as much as to carelessness
and mischief. It is ignorance of what
to do in case of a fire that permits a small blaze
to grow into a consuming flame that wrecks
blocks of buildings and wastes millions of dollars
worth of property.</p>

<p>&#8220;If everyone knew just what to do and did it
at once, you can understand that there would be
little danger. Of recent years, the large schools
in cities have introduced a course of lessons that
take up &#8216;First Aids&#8217; and &#8216;Presence of Mind&#8217; tests
for the children so that they may be ready to
apply such knowledge when needed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have most likely heard the proverb:
&#8216;Fire makes a good servant, but a bad master.&#8217;
Now just as long as we keep fire in its rightful
place to do all sorts of work for us, and to keep
us warm in winter, or to create steam in the
water placed on it for many important services,
then fire is the servant. But once let it get the
least bit of headway through neglect, or mischief,
or by any other cause, and it immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
consumes whatever it touches and feeds upon all
it burns so that it becomes a raging demon.</p>

<p>&#8220;A child can control a fire in the stove or in
a lamp&mdash;all one has to do is to turn down the
wick or pull out a damper. But once we let
fire leap from its bounds, we need a force to
fight it. And that is what I expect of you boys.
To so train yourselves that in case of emergency,
you will know instantly how to fight the demon,
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;To help you all I can, I have invited one of
New York&#8217;s Fire Commissioners to visit us
shortly and tell you many wise things I do not
know in connection with this work. But long
before he comes I want you to be practicing daily
and have sham-fires. I have a hand-engine waiting
in the great barn back of the tool-house, and
enough hose to reach from the brook to any Nest
or building in the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have also ordered, but they have not yet
arrived, a set of small ladders and hooks and
other implements useful in case of fire. All apparatus
for the Fire Department will be kept
in this new shed back of us, and no Little Citizen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
is ever to be allowed inside this door, unless it
be one of the boys detailed as a fireman.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ten boys will have a dark-brown camp-uniform
to show you are Firemen; and in case
of a fire you will don the heavy overalls and
caps kept in the Fire-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Uncle Ben explained the plan and held up
a sample fireman&#8217;s uniform, the boys shouted
and whistled and clapped with delight, for this
sort of thing was very unusual and gratifying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Firemen, you may stand back while I
call out our Police Force. The twelve boys on
the right will step up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chosen Firemen retired after being introduced,
and the twelve policemen eagerly ran over
to Uncle Ben&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are to be our official policemen in
camp. They are going to be taught all that a
policeman needs to do and know, and they are
responsible for the laws and good reputation of
Happy Hills. If anyone needs help or advice
about matters here or in any personal problem,
the policeman must give what aid he can.</p>

<p>&#8220;The police must see that rules and regulations
are carried out to the letter, and all games,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
drills, or other public gatherings must be ordered
by them, and all nuisances removed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a member of either Fire Department or
Police Force is disloyal to his fellow-man or
breaks his vow to live up to the laws governing
his department, he will be discharged, and another
boy elected to fill the vacant place. But I
hope no such vacancies will occur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Ben then mentioned other important
things and good points in managing the camp,
and told the police he had blue uniforms for
them to wear when on duty. He held up a suit
made of blue denim, and a cap to match, but no
clubs were to be given to this police force!
Weapons were tabooed by Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys, I want each of you to &#8216;do his bit&#8217;
in this camp, and to drill well so that you can
give a fine exhibition of your ability when called
upon to use it. I expect the Blue Birds and
Bobolinks at Happy Hills next week, and it will
be a great surprise to them to see what we have
accomplished in so short a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys quickly agreed to study and practice
well, so Uncle Ben smiled approvingly and
called upon a group of girls to step forward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
There were six girls from ten to twelve years
of age in one group, and four, of thirteen years,
in another group.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you see six nurses who will have charge
of the Little Citizens who should accidentally be
scratched, cut or have any other physical trouble.
These nurses will have the right to go to the
infirmary and use whatever they may need for a
patient. But they will have to ask the grown-up
in charge of the infirmary for the needed
remedy.</p>

<p>&#8220;These nurses will also see that Little Citizens
are careful of their manner of living in camp,
and will report anyone who breaks the rules or
is careless of the welfare of others.</p>

<p>&#8220;The four big girls you see in the other group
are Mother&#8217;s Helpers. Everyone knows what
a Mother&#8217;s Helper is, and with these four Helpers
to go about and offer help to any little Mother
Wings, there ought to be a chance for everyone
to have a good time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take Maggie, for instance! Maggie has six
little brothers and sisters to look after, and they
are a handful. Now one of these official
Mother&#8217;s Helpers can help Maggie in the morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
so that she need not be late for breakfast on
account of having so many little ones to wash
and dress,&#8221; explained Uncle Ben, smiling at
Maggie.</p>

<p>The latter heaved a deep sigh and said: &#8220;Oh
t&#8217;ank you, Uncle Ben!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomorrow morning at nine o&#8217;clock sharp, the
Firemen will drill at this place, and at ten
o&#8217;clock the Police Force will meet and drill,&#8221;
said Uncle Ben, and the meeting was over for
that day.</p>

<small>THE BLUE BIRDS VISIT HAPPY HILLS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>A week had passed by swiftly while the Firemen
and Police Force practiced and drilled constantly
to become proficient in their work. And
the official nurses found many little ways in
which to help with the smaller children and when
anyone was in trouble. Miss Martin had thought
out a plan, and was beginning a story-telling
class to be held directly after luncheon in the big
Refectory. She purposely called it story-telling
so the Little Citizens wouldn&#8217;t think they were
being bored with lessons or class.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys, show me what you can do today&mdash;for
tomorrow our visitors are coming, you
know,&#8221; said Uncle Ben, as he called his Firemen
and Police together at the Big Park, as it was
styled.</p>

<p>But there were still other squads waiting to
show off what they could do, and these groups
had not yet been introduced to the general public.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, my friends, what I discovered
after our last week&#8217;s meeting. I found that we
needed a Camp Cleaning Department and a
Health Department. The Camp Cleaners are
elected every two weeks, and the ones doing their
work best during the two weeks win medals.
Those in the Health Department work a month,
and are given a certificate if the time has been
well applied to duty. The reason for limiting the
Cleaning Department to two weeks is because
there is much daily work to attend to, and this
Force really works more in two weeks than any
other department in a month.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Nurses are under the Health Department
and both the Health and Nurse Departments
are supervised by the Infirmary Head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomorrow morning the Street Cleaning Department
begins work. Each of the twelve boys
is equipped with a big round basket on a push-mobile,
and a broom and shovel. The paths that
lead through or across the camp-site will be
cleaned of papers, or any other trash that is
likely to fly about where there are so many children.
It is the duty of every Mother Wings to
have the trash-bag waiting in front of the Nest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
so the Cleaning Department can remove the bags
and leave empty ones in their place&mdash;exactly as
we do in New York.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Health Board must visit and inspect the
Nests each day and report any lack of attention
or seeming cause for concern to the Mother&#8217;s
Helpers, Nurses, and Infirmary Head. Then
the Helper investigates at once and the Nurse
sees if there is anything she can do, and both report
to the Infirmary. If it is serious the Head
immediately attends to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our Health Board wears this uniform,&#8221; and
Uncle Ben held up white percale overalls with
blue stripes on the collar and cuffs of the under-blouse
that went with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And our Street Cleaning Department wears
this uniform,&#8221; then a pair of white overalls
without stripes, but a white helmet to match the
overalls, were shown to the enthusiastic Little
Citizens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the most fun you ever heard of?&#8221;
cried one boy, who was a Health Officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I wish we could live at Happy Hills all
the time!&#8221; came from a Policeman, wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Little Citizens, we will stand back and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
watch a trial drill of our brave Firemen,&#8221; called
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>The big boys belonging to the fire department
now ran to the shed they had called the &#8220;Fire-house,&#8221;
and were soon in their uniforms. Then
they performed as only eager, enthusiastic boys
can before a number of spectators. They were
applauded loudly and Uncle Ben said they were
ready for the Grand Exhibit on the morrow.</p>

<p>The Police Force drilled next, and they, too,
were heartily applauded. The second exhibition
ended, Uncle Ben ordered all to fall in line and
march away to play.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish we had a brass band, Mr. Ta&#8217;mage!
Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun to have parades!&#8221; called the
Fire Chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Bill, that&#8217;s a fine idea! Are there any
Little Citizens here who can play on an instrument?&#8221;
asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kin play a fiddle!&#8221; squeaked a weak boy&#8217;s
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a mouth-organ,&#8221; called another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beat the drum!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ust to play a fife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can blow a horn&mdash;I got paid fer it on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
East Side, when any patent medicine quack
wanted to get a crowd around to buy his stuff,&#8221;
admitted one of the big Firemen.</p>

<p>And a score or so of boys all cried that they
wanted to play something in the band. Uncle
Ben knew music was a great thing in a community
even if it had a discordant sound at
first; it would be helpful and elevating for them
even to try and play.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to act on Bill&#8217;s suggestion at once!
I will wire Mr. Richards to pick out the instruments
we may need to begin a Camp Band. He
will know what to buy,&#8221; declared Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Mister Ta&#8217;mage, tell him not to waste
his good money buyin&#8217; &#8217;em new&mdash;he kin git all
kinds and all sizes of music instruments at a
pawn-shop along the Bowery. Me brudder got
a fine bass horn at one, fer a quarter of what it
was wuth!&#8221; bawled a big East Side German boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah! Hear Dutchy talk! It takes your big
brudder what was practicin&#8217; music fer yer Kaiser,
to grab a bargain!&#8221; jeered Young Italy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t not! My brudder is blowin&#8217; his
horn fer a enlist camp on Long Island&mdash;so now!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
An&#8217; my fadder and mudder are natural Americaners,
I want to tell you yet!&#8221; retorted Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here, boys! No war arguments at
Happy Hills! It is absolutely forbidden! Bill
is as good a citizen as I am and should anyone
question my veracity on the subject, he can leave
camp now! We don&#8217;t want to give our Police
Force any unnecessary trouble and I know what
such a discussion will lead up to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ta&#8217;mage, I gotta cymbals to my house
in New York. My uncle left them wid us when
he was drafted,&#8221; said another boy from the
ranks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You write at once, Jimmy, and ask your
mother to send them on to us,&mdash;collect. You can
play the cymbals in the band,&#8221; declared Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>But that brought down a flood of trouble upon
his unsuspecting head, as every boy at camp
instantly yelled and begged for some position in
the new Brass Band, although many of them
had not the slightest idea of the difference between
a half-note and a fish-worm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It all boils down to this: We&#8217;ve got to buy
instruments and all take part in the band. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
girls will have to take up the choral work and
give musicals in singing while we accompany
them in playing,&#8221; determined Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>The Blue Birds and Bobolinks arrived about
noon, the day following the drill and the decision
to start a brass band. As the noisy party
stopped before Aunt Selina&#8217;s door, each one tried
to crane his neck for a glimpse of the wonderful
camp they had been the means of founding. But
the trees screened everything from curious eyes;
still the shouting and laughter could be heard,
although even that was mellowed by the distance
from the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Ben, we are wild to see the Little
Citizens. Aunt Selina and you have not written
half enough to satisfy us!&#8221; cried Ruth Talmage,
as she jumped at her uncle, the moment the automobile
stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Ben, Mr. Richards telephoned us this
morning early, that he couldn&#8217;t come with us.
You must have told him to get some stuff in New
York. He said he would attend to it today and
leave the city on a midnight train, so&#8217;s to be here
tomorrow,&#8221; said Ned Talmage, delivering the
message as he was asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine, Ned! If Mr. Richards can get
what I want there will be a heap of fun at Happy
Hills this summer,&#8221; replied Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;As if there was no fun here!&#8221; laughed Miss
Selina.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&mdash;come on, and don&#8217;t stand there
talking! I want to see the camp,&#8221; called Don
Starr, catching hold of Jinks&#8217; hand to pull him
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment! Don&#8217;t you want something
to eat?&#8221; questioned Mr. Talmage.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why can&#8217;t we eat in the Refectory with
the Citizens?&#8221; wondered Meredith Starr aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing, Uncle Ben! We don&#8217;t want a
ready-made house with fine furniture and things,
when we have a dandy camp right at hand where
a fellow can rough it for a few days!&#8221; added
Don, and he felt very impressive with the manner
in which he said &#8220;rough it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Little Citizens were expecting their young
benefactors, and the whole camp was as spick
and span as a Street Cleaning Department could
make it; and every child was polished till it shone,
thanks to the Mother&#8217;s Helpers; and the Police
Force was uniformed and waiting at cross paths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
of the camp ready to salute the group of Blue
Birds and Bobolinks the moment they passed
the City Line. Only the Fire Department was
invisible, but they were waiting impatiently at
the Fire House for the signal that would bring
them out in a glorious show.</p>

<p>For be it known, my friends, that the Police
Force, the Street Cleaning Department, and the
Fire Company, had planned a secret all unknown
to Uncle Ben, or any Little Citizen&mdash;at least a
non-official citizen&mdash;that meant the girls, as
every boy in camp belonged to some Civic Department
or other and wore its uniform.</p>

<p>The secret was so well guarded that not even
I had a peep of it, but it was dreadfully exciting
as one could tell by the flushed faces and meaning
signals that passed between the important
branches of the Camp Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dere dey come&mdash;jus&#8217; leavin&#8217; de house!&#8221; called
Jimmy, who was perched up on an electric light
pole to spy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way are dey takin&#8217;&mdash;Primrose Walk
or Daffodil Lane?&#8221; asked an eager voice from
the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comin&#8217; straight down Daffodil Lane&mdash;gee!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
dem boys what calls demselves Bobolinks are
swells all right!&#8221; said Jimmy, as he slid quickly
down the pole and joined his comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many of &#8217;em?&#8221; asked a boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout six er eight&mdash;big and little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How little?&#8221; came from several small boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two look to be about eight, some look ten
and de udders about Dutchy&#8217;s age,&#8221; explained
Jimmy, which goes to tell the reader that Bill,
the boy of German parentage had to suffer the
nickname of &#8220;Dutchy&#8221; in spite of Uncle Ben&#8217;s
protests. A boy will be a boy the world over!</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&mdash;all ready for the cry!&#8221; warned the
Fire Chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;One, two, three&mdash;yell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as Uncle Ben and his little friends came
up to the camp-boundary line, the Little Citizens
gave a war-cry of:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>The concerted chorus, and the syncopated
action of the scores of hearty voices was deafening
to the newcomers, especially as it was unexpected;
but it was most satisfying as the laughter
and hurrahs attested the moment the welcome
was ended.</p>

<p>Aunt Selina laughed and laughed at the way
the Little Citizens &#8217;rahed for Flutey Mah!</p>

<p>The Blue Birds and Bobolinks were then
escorted about the wonderful camp and shown
everything important or otherwise. Even the
mud-pies made by Maggie&#8217;s baby brother that
morning had to be shown and laughed over!</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my Publishing Friends, we will adjourn
to the Fire-house and watch the Fire Company
drill,&#8221; announced Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Fire Company?&#8221; asked Don, amazed&mdash;as
were the other visitors, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll soon see! Have you failed to see the
Police Squad keeping order about the town?&#8221;
laughed Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>So eager and curious about other things had
the Blue Birds and Bobolinks been, that they had
not seen the stiff boys at guard in blue uniforms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; exclaimed Ruth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;Whose idea is that?&#8221; questioned Meredith.</p>

<p>Without reply, Uncle Ben gave a signal to his
police and the men saluted, turned upon their
heel, and marched away in single file towards the
Fire-house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I want to be a fireman, too! Isn&#8217;t it
fun!&#8221; cried Don, running after the departing
Force much as a small boy would at a circus
parade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, come and see my Firemen drill,&#8221; added
Uncle Ben, laughing at the amazement on the
faces about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How lovely!&#8221; cried Vene Starr, as she realized
what had been planned by Uncle Ben for
their entertainment.</p>

<p>Immediately after the Blue Birds and Bobolinks
were stationed on a small platform near the
Fire-house, a Policeman rang the fire-gong in the
center of the camp-town. It was a great iron
hoop hung upon a cross-beam and was sounded
by striking it with a bar of metal.</p>

<p>Not until this moment had Uncle Ben noticed
anything unusual about the Park, but now he
saw a column of smoke issuing from a structure
at one end of the field that had not been there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the day before. It was loosely built of old boards
and discarded lumber thrown aside by the carpenters
when building the Nests. He understood
what it meant, too.</p>

<p>The moment the fire-gong sounded, the Little
Citizens standing about to watch the fun, began
yelling at the top of their lungs: &#8220;Fire! Fire!
Save us from the fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they all started to run for the temporary
house at the end of the field. At the same time,
the Fire Department flung open the doors of its
house and rushed out pulling the hand-engine
at their heels. The boys with the hose reel followed,
and last came the Hook and Ladder Team.</p>

<p>All made for the now flaming structure and
naturally, the visitors ran too, to watch at close
hand the daring and bravery of the Fire Department.
Uncle Ben hoped the sparks from the fire
would not start anything else as it was too near
the Nests for safety.</p>

<p>The Fire-engine reached the scene, and while
they were getting ready to pump water from the
creek into and through the hose-pipes, the other
firemen were screwing nozzles to the hose, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
connecting up the lengths so that it would reach
the burning dwelling.</p>

<p>Other firemen were placing ladders against the
side of the frail structure to pretend they were
climbing up to save lives, but Uncle Ben protested
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dare too much, boys! The shack will
collapse with a suddenness that will give you no
time to get away! Don&#8217;t scale the ladders!&#8221;</p>

<p>While he spoke, other boys were using axes
and rams on the wooden frame to show how a
closed and locked house can be made to give way
before a fireman. But the advice reached the
excited boys too late! The blows from ram and
axe had shaken the loose frame, and the flames
on the inside had eaten a way through the corner-posts
that held up the shack.</p>

<p>Just as the weight of Bill was brought full
against the side of the building, the whole thing
fell in like a house of cards. The ladder and fireman
fell with it. Instantly a dense smoke arose
from the fresh fuel, and sparks flew out in every
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Life Savers! Life Savers!&#8221; yelled the few
boys who had seen the accident, and they rushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
in to grab Dutchy from the leaping tongues of
flame that now licked up the wood.</p>

<p>The firemen at the creek heard shouting and
calling but they thought it was all part of the
game so they began pumping water into the hose,
and momentarily expected to see a fine stream
played upon the fire.</p>

<p>But the nozzle had been dropped when Bill
fell headlong into the fire and the two firemen
ran to help drag him out; now the nozzle lay
pointing directly at the Blue Birds and Bobolinks
who were intensely concerned over pulling Bill
safely out of the fire.</p>

<p>Suddenly a great stream of water shot out of
the nozzle and quickly drenched the girls standing
in its pathway. Don, taking in the situation
at a glance, ran over to hold the hose properly
and turn it upon the blaze.</p>

<p>He secured the nozzle all right, but in turning
toward the fire he had to sweep it about in a
circle, and in so doing, the rush of water from
the hose managed to drench everyone in the radius
of its swirl.</p>

<p>Amidst the screaming from the girls and the
shouting advices from the boys, the firemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
yelled and worked, while Don did his best to flood
everyone near the almost burnt-down building
with the stream pouring incessantly from the
nozzle that was being so carelessly directed by
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;For goodness sake who&#8217;s driving that flood
after me wherever I run to get away from it?&#8221;
now bawled Uncle Ben, as nearly angry as he
had ever been.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you! Gimme dat hose&mdash;cain&#8217;t ye see
ye ain&#8217;t sendin&#8217; a drop on de fire but soakin&#8217; yer
fren&#8217;s!&#8221; shouted Jimmy, as he caught the nozzle
from Don, and poured one last flood down
Dutchy&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>When poor Dutchy Bill could gasp again, he
managed to say: &#8220;Did any of you&#8217;se blockheads
t&#8217;ink a feller coul&#8217; burn wid all de creek emptyin&#8217;
itself on his back!&#8221;</p>

<p>But that was only his way of showing how
thankful he was for the timely aid given him by
his companions. For he would have been seriously
injured had not the other boys been quick
to drag him forth from the flames.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was some fire, boys!&#8221; declared the Chief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
delightedly, as he ordered the Company back to
their quarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it was a flood&mdash;not a fire!&#8221; commented
Ned, as he tried to wring out his light
summer coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;We all look as if we had just come out of the
ocean,&#8221; added Dot, grinning at the clinging organdie
dresses of her companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, it was a good blaze and heaps of excitement,
and that&#8217;s all a fellow wants at a real fire,
you know,&#8221; explained Jinks, as he remembered
the fire where Mete and he had saved some lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that were all that was needed at a fire then
every city fire would be a success as there is always
excitement to be had and a big blaze if you
give it time,&#8221; said Uncle Ben, who had recovered
his good-humor.</p>

<p>The fire apparatus was replaced in the house
and the brave firemen came out to be congratulated
on their prowess. Don being the only dry
Bobolink of his party, stood watching the boys,
and finally said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Ben, you ought to have given a medal
for bravery! Bill scaled the ladder in spite of
danger to life and limb.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to give you the medal this time!&#8221;
replied Uncle Ben, seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me! What for&mdash;what did I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wasted more water than Happy Hills
uses in a month, and you spoiled a dozen or so
good dresses and suits, so we will present you
with a leather medal!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that the older children laughed merrily, and
Don knew a leather medal was nothing to be
proud of; still he kept his tongue under control
until he had had time to ask someone what a
leather medal meant anyway!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>MISS MARTIN&#8217;S TALK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The Blue Birds and Bobolinks had to hurry
to the kitchen where a good-natured cook and
kitchen girl offered to dry their wet clothes.
Meantime, the hapless boys and girls would have
to wear overalls just as the Little Citizens did
for work.</p>

<p>The majority of the Little Citizens had followed
their visitors to the big kitchen and when
the transformed Blue Birds came out in blue
denim jumpers, everyone laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we do while we&#8217;re waiting for our
clothes to dry?&#8221; asked Dot Starr, who never
could keep quiet a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let Miss Martin tell one of her stories!&#8221; suggested
Nelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an awful good story-teller! You just
oughter hear one,&#8221; added Maggie, with the air
of one who knows.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will all sit down on the Refectory floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
while we are waiting for dry clothes, I will tell
you a short story,&#8221; agreed Miss Martin. And
everyone sat down just where he or she happened
to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall it be?&#8221; asked the lady.</p>

<p>Just then a hop-toad jumped upon the platform
of the Refectory floor and almost landed in Betty
Blue Bird&#8217;s lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh! A horrid toad!&#8221; cried she, jumping
up to shake herself free from the disagreeable
contact.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you a story about a <i>nice</i> little toad!&#8221;
laughed Miss Martin, instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, and cure Betty of her dread of wood-creatures,&#8221;
added Dot, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That little toad only hopped up to say, &#8216;Glad
to see you in the country, children!&#8217; because he
is so happy here himself, he wants everyone to
feel as happy as he does.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see Speckles&mdash;that is the toad&#8217;s name,
I&#8217;m sure&mdash;had had a dreadful long season of it
last winter as he lay dozing under the old tree-roots
over there. You will find a deep hole running
under the roots, and in the fall the wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
blows leaves and other dry material into the opening
to keep out the cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speckles has a wide mouth and great shining
eyes, but his eyes could see nothing to eat in the
tunnel where he waited for spring, and his
mouth had chewed nothing since the cold blast
of winter had driven him to cover late in the
fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speckles was too tired and cold and hungry
to force a way out to the open until he was quite
sure there would be a fair-sized meal for his
empty stomach, so he waited and dozed some
more. As he dozed he wondered&mdash;and that made
a dream you know&mdash;where Spot, his mate, could
be. Was she still sleeping or was she out and
working for something to eat?</p>

<p>&#8220;That made Speckles sit up! He rubbed his
button eyes with a fore-foot and yawned&mdash;oh
what a yawn from that great mouth! He determined
to go out for some air. Perhaps, who
knows&mdash;there might be a tidbit about somewhere
to ease the gnawing in his insides!</p>

<p>&#8220;The dry leaves were soon pushed out and
forth came Speckles, but a very different-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
toad from the fat one that went into winter
quarters the previous fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good-day, Mr. Cricket!&#8217; said Speckles, politely,
to a very tender-looking cricket that sat
just above his reach on a twig.</p>

<p>&#8220;Being once removed on the plane above a
common toad, Mr. Cricket never deigned to notice
the polite greeting. Had the <i>toad</i> been
above, the entire scene would have changed instantly!
Perhaps proud Mr. Cricket would have
been the suppliant for life and liberty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speckles hopped over to the tunnel to which
he had escorted his mate the season before, and
now he churked a sickly roundelay to wake her
from her dreams. Spot was having a glorious
dream of bugs and maggots and all kinds of
toothsome dainties, and the faint call from her
mate failed to rouse her the first time. Again
he chirruped, a bit louder and stronger this time,
and Spot awoke with a shock to find her feast
vanish! It was but a dream!</p>

<p>&#8220;Spot then waddled out&mdash;she need not have
waddled, as she was thin and scrawny, but she
was still dreaming that she had stuffed herself
at the feast, so she waddled. Then, too, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
joints were stiff from the cramped position she
had been in for many months.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ha, Spot, my dear!&#8217; saluted Speckles, as he
saw his mate stumbling from the winter resort.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, Speck, have you found any dinner?&#8217;
was the first house-wifely question from Spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I met Mr. Cricket, but he seemed very lean
and unsatisfying, so I passed him up,&#8217; replied
Speckles.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, did you? Or did he hop up himself?&#8217;
tittered Spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Isn&#8217;t it all the same, my dear? I did not eat
him!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spot gave a sleepy look at her spouse but said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have been thinking, my dear wife, that
perhaps some of our friends may hold a musicale
at the frog-pond tonight&mdash;shall we hop down and
see? We may find some juicy bugs on the way,
too.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, let us be off! I must find a home for
the children as soon as possible, too, and perhaps
the tepid water of the mud-hole will be just right
for the eggs.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the pair hopped away from the trees and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
were soon at a small spot beside the creek, where
the water had made a tiny bay in the bank. On
the way they found a spider and a few thin ants,
but what was such a tiny mouthful to such hungry
toads?</p>

<p>&#8220;On the muddy brink of the small inlet, Spot
sat and wondered! Here she had laid a number
of tiny eggs the spring before, and these had
hatched out into fine, fat little tadpoles. How
well she remembered the day the tads turned into
tiny toads with wide gaps for mouths and bright
button eyes like her own, and had hopped out of
the water to prance about and play with each
other!</p>

<p>&#8220;Where now were all those dear children?
Would any of them remember the old home-spot
and return to bring their grand-children, and
gladden the old frogs?</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, well,&#8217; sighed Spot, &#8216;It is the way of all
human nature! Once the child is grown it
throws off all restraint and protecting care of
parents and plunges headlong into life!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Speckles interrupted her thought by calling
her attention to an old decayed log under
which he had just burrowed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Spot&mdash;come quick! A fine mess of bugs
here!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Spot jumped over to gorge herself on the
feast&mdash;almost as delicious a feast as in the dream,
but far more satisfying than the dream-feast had
been.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spot then made her way carefully down the
muddy bank and waddled out to water that
reached to her nose. The rest of her body was
submerged. There she sat all night, listening to
the singing of the male toads who serenaded
their mates on the banks, while their wives were
attending to family duties.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speckles sang and sang, too, as he sat on the
grassy bank just above Spot where she was laying
the yearly batch of eggs.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the first streak of dawn, Speckles whispered:
&#8216;Spot, the day is breaking&mdash;we must
away to our home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spot scrambled out at that, and followed her
mate to the woods, saying as she went: &#8216;I wish
we could have a grand family reunion this year,
Speckles. When the new eggs hatch out into
polliwogs, I would like to have our children of
last year come home and meet the babies.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;&#8216;That is a silly mother&#8217;s sentiment! I suppose
our large family of last year is well-scattered
in every direction this year.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spot said nothing but sighed for she knew
how useless it was to wish an impossible wish!</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time after this event, the eggs laid by
Spot that lovely moonlight night, hatched into
queer little black things with but two legs and a
slippery tail. Some of the saucy polliwogs
whisking about in the outside creek jeered:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pooh! You Tads! Where are your front
legs?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;They&#8217;ll grow soon, and when they do we&#8217;ll
come out there and duck you impudent Polliwogs!&#8217;
threatened one Tad, named Tibby.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the bare mention of &#8216;duck&#8217; every Tad
jumped and even Tibby Tad shivered with apprehension,
for it was well known that a duck was
a deadly foe to a Polliwog or a Tadpole.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Quick&mdash;run to cover! Here comes a duck!&#8217;
shouted a Polliwog from the larger creek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Instantly every Tad burrowed down through
the muddy inlet and remained hidden until they
heard the Pollys&#8217; laugh and jeer, then the Tads
knew they had been made sport of.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m going to swim out there and slap that
Polliwog&#8217;s face!&#8217; exclaimed Tibby Tad, as he
started up from the soft mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just then a dreadful thing happened on the
surface of the water above him. A big black
thing fell ker-splash into the pool, and the ripples
circled about as it tried to scramble forth
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;The big black bug saw the Tads, however,
and made a quick dive for them. Alas! Some
were caught and gobbled up, but Tibby escaped
without a scratch!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That wasn&#8217;t a duck, but it was just as bad
as one,&#8217; said Tibby to himself, as he decided not
to swim out to the big creek that day but stick
close to the home-bank of mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time after this, the other legs began
to grow and the Tads who had survived the
raids of ducks, beetles, bugs and other enemies,
found they could hop feebly to the bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why this is our birthday&mdash;we are six weeks
old today,&#8217; exclaimed Tibby, as he managed to
scramble out of the puddle and sit up in the
grass, panting after the unusual exertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;He watched his brothers and sisters crawl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
up beside him, and after a time, they began to
jump and have the most fun! Leap-frog was
too strenuous for that day, as the little legs would
wobble when they tried to hop.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come with me, Tina,&#8217; coaxed Tibby to his
sister, as he found she was the sturdiest of the
lot who had hopped from the pool.</p>

<p>&#8220;As Tibby and Tina hopped away, a few of
their brethren followed. Now and then the Tads&mdash;or
Toads they now were&mdash;stopped to feast
upon an unknown tidbit, but they ate it whether
it was familiar and certified by the Pure Food
Commission or not! They ate and ate, every
sort of bug or worm they found, and not a single
thought was wasted on Mr. Hoover or his wartime
rations! Tibby and Tina were not very
patriotic in their self-denial that first day out
of the puddle!</p>

<p>&#8220;Tibby led the way, for he was the bravest
of the party. Soon he came to a tall grassy
place where he heard a queer sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tina, do you hear?&#8217; asked Tibby.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, brother, what is it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No time to ask&mdash;run, Tina!&#8217; cried Tibby, and
the two made a mighty leap just in time to escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
a quail that pounced down upon the tiny toads
and gobbled one quickly out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It was Clumsy that disappeared!&#8217; sighed
Tina, all sympathy for the awkward little toad
that could not escape death.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Watch out for other assassins! We know
not where the next may lurk,&#8217; whispered Tibby,
for he was poetical as well as practical, you see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tina admired her big brother and watched
carefully as he had advised, so she was the first
to spy a swift animal with a bushy tail. What
was it? How it did jump&mdash;almost as fast and
high and far as a toad!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Run, Tina, Run! It&#8217;s a squirrel!&#8217; shouted
Tibby, as the tiny toads stood petrified with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;The squirrel soon had the smallest and weakest
of the family and that left four to wander
along heart-broken over their loss.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I fear we shall end like the &#8220;ten little niggers
that sat on a gate,&#8221;&#8217; wailed Tibby, the poem
of those unlucky little black children appealing
to him at the moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tibby, will you or I be the last one to swing
on the gate and then fall off, so there was none?&#8217;
mournfully asked Tina.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>&#8220;Suddenly, before Tibby could reply, there was
a happy cry and two fat toads appeared who
greeted the four baby toads.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh my darlings&mdash;it is Mamma Spot! Don&#8217;t
you know me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Speckles puffed up proudly as he saw
young Tibby and the baby brother, and said,
&#8216;Tib, my son, I am glad to see you have brought
the children safely home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;What became of the other tads in the puddle
I never could find out, but the four we followed
to the woods lived happily with Speckles and Spot
and as they grew up and married they raised
their Tads in that same puddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pretty toad that jumped into Betty&#8217;s lap
a while ago was either Father Speckles or Tibby,
who sniffed something to eat and wondered if we
humans ate the same delicious bugs that he preferred
above everything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone clapped at the ending of the story
and Betty laughed gayly, as she admitted that
she would like to find Tibby, just to tell him how
glad she was he had escaped from his enemies.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>LITTLE MOTHER MAGGIE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The clothes were dry, and the Blue Birds and
Bobolinks were again dressed, but Uncle Ben
advised them to keep the overalls to protect their
good clothes while they were playing in camp.</p>

<p>Tea&mdash;it was called supper at Happy Hills&mdash;was
served at 6 p. m. sharp each day, and now the
Refectory was soon arranged for the children.
As the Oakdale visitors intended having the
evening meal at the camp Refectory, a table was
set out for them.</p>

<p>Maggie found the neighboring table the one
occupied by the adored Blue Birds, and very
little did she eat that noon! Even the table manners
of her six little sisters and brothers failed to
distract her attention from watching the girls at
Uncle Ben&#8217;s table.</p>

<p>Supper over, Uncle Ben said: &#8220;Now what shall
we do?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go over and look at the Little Farms,&#8221;
said Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, Uncle, you see we want to know what
to say in the next issue of the magazine when we
offer prizes to the farmers of Happy Hills,&#8221; said
Ruth.</p>

<p>The Little Citizens had gathered around and
now looked eager to hear more of the prize idea.
Uncle Ben surmised as much and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt if the Little Citizens have heard of
your plan to distribute prizes. I will tell them
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Citizen Farmers, I beg to announce that the
Blue Birds and Bobolinks are about to give a
prize for the best kept farm in camp, another
for the largest vegetable of ten varieties raised;
the ten to be radishes, beets, cabbage, carrots, turnips,
squash, beans, potatoes, onions, and corn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another prize will be given for the greatest
amount of good produce raised on one farm this
summer. Yet another will be awarded to the
farmer who makes the most of rotating crops.
I have explained to you what that is.</p>

<p>&#8220;As most of you have just started the farms
you can all begin fairly to try for the prizes. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
age and size of the farmer will have much to do
with the judgment of the Blue Birds. So I suggest
that the farmers be divided in classes, one
for boys of eight and over, one for girls of eight
and over; another class for children&mdash;boys and
girls&mdash;under eight years of age. The prize will
be duplicated for these classes. Any remarks?&#8221;</p>

<p>There were none, so Uncle Ben led his young
visitors to inspect the farms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ta&#8217;mage, we&#8217;se gotta street cleanin&#8217;
squad, an&#8217; a police force, an&#8217; a health board wid
nusses, an&#8217; to say nuttin&#8217; of dem firemen, but we
hain&#8217;t got no head farmers in camp to show helpers
all de time, what we wants to know,&#8221; ventured
a voice from the crowd that followed at
Uncle Ben&#8217;s heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so! Farmer Jones is master here, but
he can&#8217;t be at everyone&#8217;s beck and call. We&#8217;ll
have to plan a farmer club tomorrow, and I will
send down books and pamphlets for all to read
or study.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t some gals be in the farmer clubs
as well as the boys that have everyt&#8217;ing goin&#8217;,&#8221;
remarked Mother Maggie.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Maggie! We men have to share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
alike with you women now that you have the vote
in New York State!&#8221; said Uncle Ben, smiling
at his Citizens.</p>

<p>At the Little Farms the visitors were delighted
to see what had already been done. Mr. Jones
was there to explain things.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, we worked very hard at digging the
plots when the first Little Citizens arrived at
camp, and now, as new arrivals come each day,
they too are set to work at their farms; so we
will have some farms harvesting while others are
just sprouting their first crop.</p>

<p>&#8220;I showed the children how to dig and work
over the soil until it was right for planting. Then
I taught them how to choose the right seed for
this time of the year, and each child was shown
how to plant the seed chosen by him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you see, some plants are already growing
fine, and some are just sprouting from the
ground. Some farms have been seeded and are
not yet sprouting, and some have just been made
ready to plant.</p>

<p>&#8220;We farmers think it great fun to hunt the
bugs and worms that would injure our plants.
We are very careful to keep the ground well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
watered so the roots can keep healthy and feed
the green shoots above the earth. We have some
fine radishes that will soon be large enough to
pull for dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill&#8217;s radishes are the best and finest, and he
will soon be able to pull some and sell them to
the cook at the Refectory at market price.&#8221;</p>

<p>This attracted attention to Bill&#8217;s garden and
the children took great pride in the order and
neatness of the farm-plot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks as if Bill might win a prize for neatness,&#8221;
said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;se diden&#8217; say what de prize was! Ef
it&#8217;s going to be a choice of t&#8217;ings, lemme take cash,
&#8217;cuz I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to save all dis summer an&#8217; lay by to
git a farm fer us all ferever!&#8221; vowed Maggie,
enthusiastically, as she waved her arm at her six
brethren.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will consider that matter for you, Maggie,
and decide what the prize shall be,&#8221; agreed
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>As the children went from one well-kept farm
to the next, something interesting was learned
from each plot.</p>

<p>For instance the Blue Birds heard from Farmer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Jones that a radish was really a root. Because
of its red color it could be mistaken for
fruit or a bulbous vegetable, but it grows and
produces stems with leaves, so it must be classed
with root vegetables.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides all this, a thin root tapers from the
round bulb. It is this long tapering root that
finds the food and drink in the deep, dark ground
for the plant above ground to grow upon,&#8221; explained
the Farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the interesting thing about a radish is
this: the plant stores up food in its root for its
own use. It takes the first half of its life to make
a great big root, and when the root is fully grown
and the upper green leaves are through, it dies.
Then there shoots up a long slender stem, and
on top of this the flowers of the radish bloom.
As these in turn fade and die, the seeds form and
the entire plant dies&mdash;its work accomplished.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we dig up a dried radish plant we will find
the round radish entirely changed in appearance.
Instead of a juicy red bulb we find a shrivelled
colorless root, because the stem and flowers that
finally turned to seed ate up all the nourishment
the green leaves had given to the radish-root.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
And the stored up food gone, there was nothing
to draw upon, so the root died, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How interesting! Do tell us some more, Mr.
Jones,&#8221; exclaimed Vene Starr.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, here&#8217;s a potato. Is that a fruit, a
root, a plant, or a bulb?&#8221; asked Farmer Jones,
smiling at his catch-words.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a root,&#8221; shouted Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s a plant&mdash;a potato-plant,&#8221; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a bulb&mdash;like tulips or other bulbs,&#8221;
added Vene.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s neither, children&mdash;a potato is a stem!&#8221;
said the tickled farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;A stem&mdash;what to?&#8221; asked many curious
voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you: A potato is an underground
stem with all the properties of a stem but it shoots
downward instead of up above the soil.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see a potato has many eyes, and these
eyes grow when properly cut and planted. The
white shoot pushes itself up out of the ground
and bears leaves, which is the vine, or plant.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old potato which was planted to furnish
food for the plant is gradually used up as the
green leaves open out and grow to be a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
healthy vine. Then, the old food-store being
used, and the potato-plant flourishing, new roots
or stems grow downward from the plant; these
swell out, and out, and out, until all the little
tendrils that would be long thin roots in another
kind of vegetable, are swollen bulb-like tubers of
the potato-plant.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the plant is exhausted and can furnish
no more life and strength to its underground
tubers, it dies, and the potatoes stop growing.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a plant above ground kept on indefinitely
furnishing life and food to the potatoes underground,
they would keep on increasing until one
hill would supply more than one ever saw. But
the plant produces just so many tubers and then
stops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that is funny! I never dreamed a potato
worked so hard for us,&#8221; giggled Dot Starr, as the
farmer concluded his talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is a carrot or turnip a stem or bulb, too?&#8221;
asked Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, a carrot, like the radish, is a root and is
grown from seed. As the seed bursts open, the
sprout sends up two tiny leaves, while the root
goes down into the earth to seek food for its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
plant. The root grows fatter and fatter as it
keeps on feeding the green leaves that in turn
give the root sunshine and air. In the fall when
the plant dies, the carrot is ready to be dug out
and used.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it remains in the ground through the winter,
it freezes but does not die. In spring, it
sends up a new shoot and this flowers to make
seeds. The old carrot in the ground dies as its
seeds are perfected, for it has produced the
wherewithal for many more plants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose the turnip and beet and other swollen
roots are all the same then,&#8221; suggested Ned, who
had been listening with great interest to Farmer
Jones&#8217; talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just about, and you can quickly determine
for yourself which class a vegetable belongs to
by examining the root or full-grown product.
A cabbage, kohlrabi, and similar vegetables are
not roots.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the children passed other Little Farms,
they found that some owners had planted dwarf
and bush peas; dwarf and climbing beans; and
other vegetables not commonly used by other
Little Citizens.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Maggie appeared very eager as they neared
her small farm, and finally, Vene called out to
the others:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, see that pretty plot. Full of flowers!
Whose is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Little Mother Maggie&#8217;s,&#8221; replied the
farmer, smiling at the wizened little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;How neat and well-kept,&#8221; commended Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Maggie spends all her spare time here
and takes great pride in the plants. I told her
the variety to plant to show quick results; but
now she has a box full of young plants at the
Nest, where she is starting later flowers for her
garden when these are gone,&#8221; explained Farmer
Jones.</p>

<p>As Maggie could do with her garden what she
pleased, she now went carefully between the rows
of flowers and gathered all that were full-blown.
These she presented to Uncle Ben and to the Blue
Birds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Maggie, why did you pluck all the lovely
blossoms?&#8221; cried Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farmer Jones says dey make twice as many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
flowers if I keep a-pickin&#8217; dose wide open an&#8217;
ready to fade,&#8221; replied Maggie, astutely.</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance, take a pansy plant,&#8221; added the
farmer. &#8220;A plant may only produce a few blossoms
and these will be very large and beautiful.
But cut them off as soon as they are fully opened
and the plant will send up more buds&mdash;not quite
as large. If these are picked too, more buds will
appear, but will be still smaller, and so on. If
you want to produce an extraordinarily large and
beautiful flower on a plant, you pinch off every
bud that appears excepting the one you wish
over-fed with the plant&#8217;s food. All the strength
and vitality that would be divided between many
blossoms now goes to the one and produces an
extra large and fine single flower.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I go home I&#8217;m going to plant flowers
and try that idea,&#8221; said Vene Starr.</p>

<p>The Little Citizens were almost finished with
the inspection of the farms when a signal sounded
from the fire-gong. The visitors looked at each
other for an explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the call for evening song,&#8221; said Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who started that idea?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>&#8220;Flutey. She said no child should go to bed
without having its soul lifted to a sense of harmony
that would really affect its sleeping hours.
And we find the singing is really a good thing
for us all,&#8221; explained Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>The Little Citizens seemed to look forward to
this song-exercise and soon all were seated in
the open Refectory, where a small upright piano
stood. One of the young women who helped
with the Nests, sat down before the instrument
and played a gay little air; then the signal
sounded for silence.</p>

<p>Miss Selina made it her business to be present
at these song-times, and generally stood up after
the prelude and offered a very short, simple
prayer. Then the Little Citizens sang.</p>

<p>In the short time they had been at Happy Hills,
most of them had memorized several sweet songs,
and could sing really well. Uncle Ben and his
group sat in the back row the better to get the
effect of the chorus singing, and when the lovely
song called &#8220;The Prince of Peace&#8221; was finished
he felt that he must wipe his eyes for they were
moist.</p>

<p>The Blue Birds and Bobolinks encored this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
song with such enthusiasm that Flutey smiled
and said: &#8220;Little Citizens, our visitors appear
to favor that selection. Suppose we now treat
them to the new one we have been learning. How
many think they can sing it in public?&#8221;</p>

<p>Someone had drawn out a large paper chart
from back of the piano and now it stood in the
center of the room. Upon it the visitors saw the
words of the song plainly written for all to read
or learn by heart.</p>

<p>The pianist played the air over once and some
of the children hummed it eagerly. Then they
all stood up and sang.</p>

<p>It was &#8220;The Song of Love&#8221; and as the childish
voices filled the place and echoed from the
woods and vale, Uncle Ben felt that this was one
way to introduce universal peace and brotherhood.
However could such a motley gathering
of city waifs, whose parents most likely came
from every known country in Europe, return
home feeling the same in mind and soul as before
spending this summer at Happy Hills! He knew
it was impossible, and that every child singing
there that night must be benefited permanently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
by the words and music of such songs as Miss
Selina had purposely selected.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben made another great discovery during
that singing, but he made no mention of it
at the time. He was determined to investigate
the matter well before taking others into his
secret.</p>

<p>Little Mother Maggie, because she had to keep
her little family quiet and in order during the
singing, generally sat at the back of the class.
Uncle Ben sat directly beside her and so made
his discovery.</p>

<p>When the Even Song was ended, the children
trooped to their different Nests to retire for the
night. Uncle Ben asked the Blue Birds and
Bobolinks to escort Aunt Selina home while he
helped Maggie with the little ones. This they
eagerly agreed to do. So Maggie was delighted
to have Uncle Ben walk to the Nest with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maggie, you seem to have your hands full
with so many children,&#8221; ventured Uncle Ben,
after they had left the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, but dey&#8217;ll grow big some day an&#8217; den
I kin help myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean&mdash;help yourself?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;I means, dat den I kin do somethin&#8217; what I
wants to fer myself,&#8221; replied Maggie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you do it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dere ain&#8217;t no time, when six kids is to be
looked after&mdash;on&#8217;y maybe a bit at night when
dey is all in bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the something you want to do for
yourself, Maggie? Maybe I can help you a bit
now,&#8221; offered Uncle Ben, hoping to win the little
girl&#8217;s confidence.</p>

<p>It was not difficult, as Maggie was frank and
confiding by nature, so she stopped short in the
pathway and exclaimed rapturously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Mister Uncle Ben! I loves de flowers
growin&#8217;, I loves pickshers! I loves pritty people
like Miss Martin an&#8217; de Blue Birds an&#8217; you! An&#8217;
oh! how I loves singin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Ben had the information he wanted!
But still he drew her out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Maggie, no one would call Miss Martin
or me pretty! And some of the Blue Birds and
Bobolinks are not nearly as good-looking as you
are,&mdash;if you were plump you would be as pretty
as anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister Uncle Ben, you don&#8217;t unnerstan&#8217;!&#8221; replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Maggie, with a worried expression. &#8220;I
diden&#8217; mean looks, don&#8217;che know&mdash;I mean somethin&#8217;
else, but I can&#8217;t call it like I wantta!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand, Maggie; and I know that you
wish to call it &#8216;individuality,&#8217; or the mental beauty
of the soul. It is this grace of each one&#8217;s thought-power
that makes true beauty and attractiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s it&mdash;yes, dat&#8217;s it, Mister Uncle Ben!
But I diden&#8217; know how to say it!&#8221; cried Maggie,
her eyes shining.</p>

<p>They had reached the Nest by this time, and
Uncle Ben was so interested, that he said he
would step in and help put the six romping sisters
and brothers to bed. Maggie was over-awed!</p>

<p>Uncle Ben took quick notice of the cleanliness
of the Nest, and the crude attempts at decoration.
Maggie had gathered wild flowers and filled
empty tin cans with water to hold the lovely
blossoms. The very arrangement of the colors
and ferns showed her artistic temperament that
so pleased the visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you remove all the paper from the
cans, Maggie? Didn&#8217;t you like the gay colors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of the printing, and the pictures of tomatoes, and
corn, and squash on the outside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh sakes alive! Dem ain&#8217;t pickshers! Dey is
awful ink ads. what folks have to make to boost
dere stuff er not sell it!&#8221; returned Maggie, scornfully.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben laughed aloud. Here was truth
indeed!</p>

<p>&#8220;So you thought that flashy tin was better,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much better, Mister Uncle Ben, but
cleaner&mdash;besides de flowers said dey wouldn&#8217;t
stay fresh if dey had to drink water from a tin
what told everyone it had one time been full of
beans!&#8221; said Maggie, with disgust at the very
idea!</p>

<p>Uncle Ben could hardly keep from laughing
again, but he did not want to offend the little
girl he was questioning. Now he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;d like something nicer to hold
flowers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no use wishin&#8217;&mdash;I hain&#8217;t even got any
green paint to paint dese tin cans wid. If dey
was green dey would look all right, &#8217;cause you see
everyt&#8217;ing&mdash;the grass, the trees, the plants demselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
is all green before the flower shoots up
and opens. An&#8217; a green can would look more
like leaves for the flowers to stick up from,&#8221; explained
Maggie.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben now found that his hostess was
logical and a student of Nature&#8217;s ways and motives.
He felt that his visit was teaching him
more about Maggie than he ever thought to
know.</p>

<p>The six little ones were in bed by this time,
and Maggie kept glancing at the electric light
which hung from the center of the sloping roof
of the Nest.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with it, Maggie?&#8221; asked Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll go out at nine sharp an&#8217; leave you in the
dark,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;then you want to go to bed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217; go to bed when dere&#8217;s a full moon
like dis one. I coulden&#8217; sleep away such a lovely
time! I likes to sit on de steps and think!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And think? Don&#8217;t you sing to the moon,
Maggie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who tol&#8217; you?&#8221; quickly countered the little
girl.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;No one told me, but the moon ought to make
you feel like singing, I think,&#8221; returned Uncle
Ben, soothingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sings soft-like so no one kin hear. It might
wake up de children an&#8217; make &#8217;em cry, so I jus&#8217;
sing inside, you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I thought. Well now, Maggie, I have a
favor to ask. Suppose we ask Miss Martin in the
next Nest to keep her eye on the sleeping children
here, while you and I walk over to the lake and
watch the moon sail over the trees. There you
can sing to me without disturbing anyone, you
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maggie looked at Uncle Ben and grasping his
arm, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do ennyt&#8217;ing for you, but you&#8217;ll wish you
never ast me to sing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Martin quickly consented to keep guard
over Maggie&#8217;s brood as well as the little ones in
her own Nest; and Uncle Ben shared his secret
with her, while Maggie sought for a hat and an
old pair of cotton gloves&mdash;for was she not going
for a walk with a real gentleman! Ladies always
wore gloves at such times.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben took Maggie&#8217;s hand to make her feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
quite at ease with him, and soon the two reached
the Summer House built on the little bluff overlooking
the ornamental lake where Aunt Selina
first heard Ruth plan for Happy Hills.</p>

<p>All was quiet and peaceful and the faint lap,
lap, lap of the water as it was lightly rippled
by the night-breezes, gave one a feeling of being
in another world. So thought Maggie.</p>

<p>She forgot where she was and who was with
her as her soul drank in the beauty of the scene,
and when Uncle Ben whispered, &#8220;Sing &#8216;The Song
of Love,&#8217; Maggie,&#8221; she sang it softly as if in
accord with her own wishes at the moment.</p>

<p>The melody came forth so pure and clear and
free, yet so controlled, that Uncle Ben marvelled.
He had found a wonder indeed!</p>

<p>Maggie softly trilled every song she had
learned at Happy Hills, and then her silent companion
took her hand and they walked back to
the Nest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diden&#8217; you like my singin&#8217;, Mister Uncle
Ben?&#8221; queried Maggie, wistfully, for he had not
said a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maggie, it was so wonderful that I can&#8217;t
speak!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;I know! I know, how you&#8217;se feel! I always
feels dat way when I stan&#8217; outside a church an&#8217;
hears some angel singin&#8217; inside. Den I want glad
rags an&#8217; fine ways so I kin go in an&#8217; <i>see</i> de shinin&#8217;
wings an&#8217; face what&#8217;s singin&#8217;!&#8221; cried Maggie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much for this treat, Maggie,
and tomorrow I will treat you in return,&#8221; said
Uncle Ben, patting her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now hurry to bed, little girl. Good-night!&#8221;
added the visitor, as Maggie stood on the top step
of the three that led to the Nest.</p>

<small>UNEXPECTED GENIUSES FOUND AT HAPPY HILLS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Ben sat up with Flutey a long time that
night, after he entered the house, and when the
two parted to go to bed, it had been decided to
experiment as Uncle Ben planned.</p>

<p>The following morning the Blue Birds and
Bobolinks heard Uncle Ben telephoning long-distance
to New York. Having secured the number
he wanted, he talked for a long time over the
wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! That call will cost Uncle Ben a lot
of money,&#8221; ventured Don, who was curious to
know what it was all about.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be money well invested if the returns
are such as we look for,&#8221; returned Flutey, smiling
but not offering to inform anyone of the cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Aunt Selina, it&#8217;s arranged! She&#8217;s coming
down with Richards this afternoon. I&#8217;m so
glad I could reach her,&#8221; said Uncle Ben, entering
the breakfast room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;And Mr. Richards said he would bring down
that music teacher who used to direct the band,&#8221;
added Miss Selina.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have quite an opera company as well
as an orchestra at Happy Hills,&#8221; laughed Uncle
Ben, highly pleased at something.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll stay at Happy Hills the rest of
the Summer, Uncle Ben, and help play the drum,&#8221;
now ventured Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! A lot you&#8217;d play! You&#8217;d only <i>beat</i> it!&#8221;
exclaimed Dot, for she knew there would be no
place for her in the band.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll <i>beat</i> it from here, all right, when we
go home again,&#8221; laughed Jinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as I finish my breakfast, I&#8217;m going
over to the camp and make a tour of each Nest.
I have important information to secure before
noon. What do you boys and girls propose
doing?&#8221; now asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we go with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go to the camp but not with me on
my tour of inspection. You must amuse yourselves
this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! We&#8217;ll go and help the Street
Cleaning Department,&#8221; offered Don.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;And we girls can watch the Health Board
work. I think it must be great fun to see those
girls teach the younger ones how to clean their
teeth and chew their food!&#8221; giggled Ruth.</p>

<p>Immediately after the morning meal had ended,
Miss Selina ordered Jackson to bring her wheelchair
out and she sat in it, ready to start.</p>

<p>Flutey was no longer troubled with rheumatism,
so it was not that she <i>had</i> to use the chair,
but Happy Hills was at least a half mile from the
house so that a walk there and back, besides
the walking about the camp, or going in and out
of the Nests, was too fatiguing for a lady long
past seventy years.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll push the chair, Jackson, as we want
to be with Aunt Selina,&#8221; said Ruth, as the manservant
waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Jackson. You may attend to other
duties,&#8221; added Flutey, smiling.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben had gone, carrying his important
secret with him, but once the Blue Birds and
Bobolinks were on their way to camp, they forgot
about his desertion of them.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben reached Miss Martin&#8217;s Nest and
engaged her in conversation over his secret. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
was as eager as he, and soon they had decided
upon what was best to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maggie, I am going to have a little talk with
you, to tell you how much I liked your singing
last night,&#8221; said Uncle Ben, walking up the steps
of Maggie&#8217;s Nest.</p>

<p>The little girl was sweeping up the floor of the
Nest as her visitor spoke, and quickly looking
up, she smiled at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to find someone to take the care
of the children entirely from your hands during
the day, Maggie, and Miss Martin says she can
easily manage them as well as those she now
has charge of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What fur?&#8221; wondered Maggie.</p>

<p>&#8220;To give you plenty of time to sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing! Me&mdash;sing all day?&#8221; cried Maggie,
amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing when you like and as often, but at certain
times of each day you must sing and practice
just the way the teacher wants you to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What teacher&mdash;have we a singin&#8217; teacher
here?&#8221; gasped Maggie.</p>

<p>&#8220;We intend having one, and she is coming
down today to start those pupils who really have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
good voices. I think you have a good voice but
she can judge better than I. If she says you can
sing, will you promise to practice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mister Uncle Ben,&mdash;<i>will I</i>?&#8221; came from
Maggie in a trembling whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Den maybe I kin sing like dose angels in Fift
Avenoo churches, hey?&#8221; added Maggie after a
moment&#8217;s thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like them, I hope&mdash;may be sweeter than
they sing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, Mister Uncle Ben! Never could a
poor kid like me sing better&#8217;n &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you wouldn&#8217;t be poor if you had a fine
voice,&#8221; ventured Uncle Ben, carefully watching
his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</p>

<p>Maggie&#8217;s eyes opened wider and wider as this
astounding statement dawned upon her mind, and
finally she dropped upon the floor beside the
broom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s so&mdash;I coul&#8217; buy de children all dey need
an&#8217; git some nice clo&#8217;es fer myself wid what was
left!&#8221; sighed she, the tears of joy coming to her
eyes.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben now felt sure he had read the girl
aright. Her first thought had been of the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
sisters and brothers who had never had what was
necessary&mdash;she came last&mdash;if anything was left!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Maggie, I&#8217;m going to give you a new
name for the singing teacher to use. You must
always be &#8216;Margaret&#8217; henceforth, and see to it,
that everyone is corrected should they call you
&#8216;Maggie.&#8217; Tell them it was my order that you be
called &#8216;Margaret.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;se sure kin read my wishes, Mister
Uncle Ben! <i>How</i> I always hated that &#8216;Maggie&#8217;
widdout any soft music in its sayin&#8217;! But Margaret
is differunt! It&#8217;s low and smooth!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even in this degree was the girl&#8217;s sense of harmony
so finely attuned that she rebelled at hearing
herself called by an inharmonious sound.</p>

<p>The teacher arrived with Mr. Richards and
the music master on the one o&#8217;clock train, and the
car soon carried them to Miss Selina&#8217;s country
estate. A group of merry children met them on
the steps of the veranda, and after a noisy time
at luncheon, all started for the camp.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben had gone over the camp-ground
that morning and made a list of names of those
Little Citizens who showed any desire for music&mdash;to
join the band or chorus at Happy Hills.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Mr. Richards had personally attended to the
order of securing instruments made especially
for half-grown young folks, and these bulky
boxes had been shipped by special delivery to the
train at the Pennsylvania railroad station that
morning. They arrived at Happy Hills on the
same train with the teachers.</p>

<p>Great was the confusion that afternoon as
many of the Little Citizens tried to blow a cornet,
bass horn or beat a drum. And such a
squeaking and squealing as issued from many
throats when the singing was tried out by the
teacher!</p>

<p>Margaret had insisted all that morning on being
called Margaret instead of Maggie, and her
head was held up an inch higher with the sense
of her promotion to a harmonious name.</p>

<p>She had allowed other girls and boys to precede
her in the testing of their voices, and now
she came last. Uncle Ben waited anxiously for
this moment, and when she stood up beside the
piano and did as the others had done, singing
&#8220;Ah, eh, oh, ooh&#8221; for the teacher, he listened
carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now sing this: and close your eyes to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
out all sight of things outside your mental vision
of song,&#8221; advised the teacher, as she sang the
queer sounds she wished the little girl to try.</p>

<p>Margaret did them, and the lady had her try
others, until the girl laughed: &#8220;I kin sing songs
better&#8217;n &#8217;em funny noises!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you? Well then let me hear you sing
&#8216;The Song of Love&#8217; that I see printed on that
chart,&#8221; replied the teacher.</p>

<p>Margaret sang it with her natural childish
voice and in spite of having never had any idea
of music other than that which inspired her
soul, the true placing of her voice and the volume
in the tones so pleased the teacher and music
master that both exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Talmage, I am sure we have a wonder
here! If she will show the same ambition to
learn properly as she does to sing naturally, we
will be amply rewarded.&#8221;</p>

<p>The training of Margaret began that summer,
and so careful was the teacher because of the
girl&#8217;s youth and refined mentality, that the course
seemed to include everything except singing lessons.</p>

<p>Margaret was taught to walk and stand properly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
and when seated or lying down, to keep her
body from sagging. She was given breathing
exercises daily, and taught to masticate her food
thoroughly. She was shown how to speak with
a sweet, low voice, and to enunciate her vowels
carefully, always listening for a harsh note or
discordant sound in her speech.</p>

<p>Easy, simple songs were permitted the girl,
but the majority of her exercises were &#8220;Ohs and
Ahs,&#8221; until she felt that singing was not quite
so easy to master as she had thought. But she
persevered, and when her growth was attained
and her voice matured with the years, Margaret
became one of the most sought-after of all soprano
church soloists!</p>

<p>Other voices were found at Happy Hills, but
none so marvelous as Little Mother Maggie&#8217;s.
A strong tenor developed from a boy&#8217;s high
singing voice; and a contralto emerged from a
Russian peasant child&#8217;s low-pitched voice. Both
became well-known public soloists and some
others who were trained that summer found success
in chorus and choir work, later in life.</p>

<p>The band was the greatest source of attraction
for the boys, however. The music master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
began instructions with ten pupils, each of whom,
having had some teaching at school, could read
notes. At first, the blare of instruments sounding
from those young, hearty lungs, caused the
audience to muffle their ears. As Uncle Ben remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me, a barnyard is on a strike!&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone laughed and the master said: &#8220;Once
more, now boys; and show Mr. Talmage how
hens cackle, roosters crow, cows moo-oo, donkeys
bray, and horses neigh&mdash;all together!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the blast that resulted made Uncle Ben
run away!</p>

<p>But harmony came from this chaos as the
boys practiced faithfully day after day, and before
the band leader returned to New York he
felt encouraged to keep up the class through the
winter months. Uncle Ben hired an assembly
room on the East Side and other boys joined
the band, each one eager enough to buy his own
instrument. Before the following spring, a band
of forty boys could play quite well!</p>

<p>So much for the musical talent at Happy
Hills!</p>

<p>A few days following the advent of the music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
teachers, Miss Martin called Uncle Ben&#8217;s attention
to little Nelly Finn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen the child use pencil and paper?&#8221;
asked Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But don&#8217;t tell me we have a born artist
among us,&#8221; laughed Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Mr. Talmage, I think we have a designer
with unusual talent,&#8221; replied Miss Martin,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Designer! Why the child has never been
outside of a dirty tenement room. Being crippled,
you know, she could not run about as other
children do. Where could she see anything to
inspire her brain to design?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t Beethoven stone deaf? And didn&#8217;t
he compose the sweetest music and most perfect
symphonies without ever having heard the sound
of them&mdash;other than in his own thoughts! That,
as well as other wonders, proves that it is not
from without that we find inspiration and true
talent. It is solely from within, and one whose
mind is seeking for the beautiful and eternal will
find it there, whether it be music, verse, form, or
color,&#8221; said Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a philosopher, Miss Martin, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
true one, at that,&#8221; said Uncle Ben, highly pleased
at his companion&#8217;s reply to his doubts.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see, Mr. Talmage, Nelly Finn may be
a great designer in mind, and the fact that she
does not lose her artistic ideas of what she sees
and feels in her thoughts, by coarse contact with
the outside world, leaves her original and expressive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, show me some of the sketches you seem
to think are so marvelous,&#8221; said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>As is generally the case, those who come to
laugh go away to wonder, and it was so with
Uncle Ben. The moment he saw the lead-pencil
lines crudely drawn on yellow manila wrapping
paper, he detected the talent displayed. He took
several of these samples with him to show Mr.
Richards.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of this work, Richards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get them?&#8221; asked the newspaper
man instantly interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, one of our Little Citizens is an expert
artist, I find,&#8221; laughed Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Talmage, this is quite clever! Do you
know, we must change the name of our campers?
They are not Little Citizens. They are Little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Wonders! Now tell me truly, where did you get
these sketches?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of Miss Martin&#8217;s Nestlings, Richards.
No less than puny Nelly Finn,&#8221; replied Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! The sister of Micky, our newsboy
and boot-black?&#8221; cried the astonished newspaper
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see myself resigning from the paper,
Talmage, and giving all my attention to discovering
talent at Happy Hills. Then to find teachers
for such talent that it may bloom in full
beauty,&#8221; laughed Mr. Richards, but he was feeling
quite serious over Nelly&#8217;s development.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t hide these talents &#8216;in a napkin&#8217;
whatever else we have to do,&#8221; added Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Nelly must just play and grow strong
this summer, then we will enter her in some
class where she will be given all the help she
needs without ruining her original ideas. Who
knows, Ben, but she may rule the world of fashion
with her designs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one would dare prophesy such a thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
to look at the wisp of a child now,&#8221; added Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>Nothing was said to Nelly about her gift, for
they all agreed it might create other ideas in her
mind than those she loved to draw upon paper.
But it had been decided that she would be given
a good home and a teacher to train her childish
ideals to conform with her talent.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we keep on digging up any more geniuses
at Happy Hills, Flutey, you will have to close
your house this winter and take a big place in
New York just to prepare a home for your Little
Wonders,&#8221; teased Mr. Richards, that night after
he had told about Nelly&#8217;s talent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not such a bad idea, at that!&#8221; added Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious, Ben! You don&#8217;t mean it&mdash;really!&#8221;
cried Miss Selina, aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not! Richards and I are homeless city
waifs, as well as the Little Citizens, so we could
live with you and help keep house,&#8221; replied Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben, think of my age! And New York, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I think of your age now, when
you have proven without a doubt that you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
only fifty-five or sixty in reality! Years count
for nothing when one is as spry as you are,&#8221;
laughed Mr. Talmage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Ben Talmage! How you talk! Only
last year I was all tied in knots with rheumatism
and couldn&#8217;t walk!&#8221; cried Flutey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Flutey, stop trying to make believe you
want to be back where I found you!&#8221; exclaimed
Ruth, indignantly.</p>

<p>The other Blue Birds laughed teasingly at
Miss Selina, and she smiled too. &#8220;Yes, I suppose
the surest way to charm back that rheumatic
state is to think of it!&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s just the same with old age! If you
keep talking and thinking of it, pretty soon you
<i>are</i> old and helpless! And we know you&#8217;re <i>not</i>&mdash;so
there!&#8221; declared Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you trot everywhere with the Blue
Birds and Bobolinks while you were at Mossy
Glen?&#8221; demanded Ned, her grand-nephew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I was visiting and had nothing else
to do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that it! Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what, Flutey!
I&#8217;ll rent the big house and ask you to visit
me all winter. Then you can run about and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
enjoy the Little Wonders we found at Happy
Hills without thinking of your age. If it is your
own home that makes you so aged, we will never
allow you to return here!&#8221; said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all talking a lot of poppy-cock stuff!
Flutey has been livelier here at Happy Hills than
I ever saw her before,&#8221; said Dot Starr, who
must have a word in everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! Doesn&#8217;t she visit the camp twice a
day, and go up and down all the steps to the
Nests, to say nothing of going about the Little
Farms, and hospital and Refectory. If she can
stand that, she can stand a little of New York,&#8221;
said Don, who felt a great attraction in this sudden
idea of a New York Home for Little Wonders!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we have all summer to plan such an
outlandish thing as Uncle Ben just sprang on
us, so we will think it over,&#8221; said Mr. Richards,
who did not think it wise to urge matters further.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we going to do tomorrow, Uncle
Ben?&#8221; now asked Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farmer Jones said he would show us what
he does with all the wastage from camp that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Street Cleaning Department wheels to the dump
each day,&#8221; said Jinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t take all morning&mdash;only an hour,&#8221;
added Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;And after that&mdash;what do you want to do?&#8221;
said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, let&#8217;s give the Little Citizens a picnic.
We can all go in installments in the autos to some
other woods or lake and have something to eat,
then play games and come back,&#8221; suggested Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, give Don a ride and something good
to eat and he is happy!&#8221; jeered Meredith.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Don&#8217;s idea is so bad, Mete,
especially as we can use some of the large farm-wagons
filled with straw for the older children.
They have not seen any part of the neighborhood
as yet, and they ought to have an outing.
We can finish all chores at camp and see that the
little farms are all right for the day, and then
leave Happy Hills about eleven; have a picnic
luncheon somewhere and return about five,&#8221; said
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where could we go?&#8221; asked several of the
Blue Birds and Bobolinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a beautiful lake nestling among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
hills not ten miles from here,&#8221; suggested Aunt
Selina. &#8220;It is used by anyone giving a picnic,
and is considered free to the public, although the
vast extent of woods is owned by a Philadelphia
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is commonly used by the public, it will
be just the spot. No harm will be done by going
there,&#8221; said Mr. Richards.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we are going on a picnic tomorrow, we
must plan all sorts of goodies to eat,&#8221; ventured
Don, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not take what we might have at the
Refectory&mdash;cook it in the woods, that&#8217;s all the
difference,&#8221; said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a picnic without cake and ice-cream!&#8221;
scorned Dot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that the ice-cream gets there safely
if Don and Dot will turn the freezers,&#8221; laughed
Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a great freezer at the camp which is
turned by electric power, so that need not worry
you longer, Don,&#8221; said Flutey consolingly.</p>

<p>So it was decided to have a picnic the following
day, and Miss Martin was telephoned at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
to ask the cook and other help if they could prepare
the necessities for the picnic dinner in time.</p>

<p>This was satisfactorily arranged, and everyone
went to bed betimes so that they might rise at an
early hour and help in various ways to enable
all to get away on time for the outing.</p>

<small>THE STREET CLEANING SQUAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It took little time for the news to spread
around the camp that a picnic was planned for
that day, and many a Little Citizen forgot newly
acquired table manners, in the eagerness to talk
it over.</p>

<p>Breakfast out of the way, the cook and her
helpers went to work to freeze cream, bake
cookies, and prepare other delicious goodies for
the treat. The Little Mothers hurried to their
Nests to attend to their several duties.</p>

<p>The Health Board went its round conscientiously
to see that all beds were aired, all dust
swept and wiped up carefully, all clothing dry
and clean, and above all, that everyone brushed
and cleaned their teeth properly.</p>

<p>The Blue Birds were present at these visits
and enjoyed watching the older girls of the camp
take charge of things and order the children
around.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>One of the Health Officers named Marybell
was a red-haired, freckled girl of twelve. She
was a born captain and now found her opportunity
in life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say you, Rebecca Einstein, who tol&#8217; you&#8217;se to
sweep that dust under de crex rug?&#8221; said Marybell
upon reaching the Nest where Rebecca had
the sweeping to do that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dere ain&#8217;t no dus&#8217; pan,&#8221; complained Rebecca.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, you&#8217;se know where t&#8217; git one, den!
Go &#8217;an git it!&#8221; ordered Marybell, pointing a determined
finger towards the kitchens.</p>

<p>Rebecca ran, glad to be away from the disconcerting
gaze of the Blue Birds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you Eliza&mdash;come here and show the
ladies your teet&#8217; an&#8217; finger-nails,&#8221; said Marybell,
selecting the girl she had the most trouble with
on those very scores.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t all done wid dem yet,&mdash;&mdash;lemme run
an&#8217; finish,&#8221; said Eliza, hurriedly, but blushing at
being caught so unexpectedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217; done! Laws me, sloven, yeh had more&#8217;n
an hour since breakfast t&#8217; do yer toilet!&#8221; exclaimed
Marybell, frowning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>&#8220;She gits out of doin&#8217; &#8217;em all the time,&#8221; willingly
tattled another girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come right here, Emmy, an&#8217; lemme see yer
own nails!&#8221; said Marybell, while the other little
girls in the Nest tittered.</p>

<p>When Emmy slowly shuffled up and held
out her fingers, Marybell expressed disgust at the
sight. &#8220;A black mark fer you&#8217;se, an&#8217; one fer
Eliza! Yeh can&#8217;t be depended upon. Mebbe yeh
better stay away from de picnic an&#8217; tend to yer
teet&#8217; an&#8217; nails!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, no! Please not dat, Marybell! Give
us all black marks, if yeh wants to, but let us go
today!&#8221; cried the two delinquents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well den, git a hustle on an&#8217; clean up before
I git back,&#8221; said she, shaking a warning head
at them and going her way to the next Nest.</p>

<p>This inspection continued, the Blue Birds enjoying
every phase of it, until they arrived at
one of the newest Nests&mdash;that is the tenants had
just come from the city. Marybell had been
asked to look after them until a regular Health
Member was selected for that district of the
camp.</p>

<p>As the visitors came near the Nest they saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
a little girl with skirts pinned up about her waist,
standing bare-legged in the creek, which was up
to her knees. She was bending over and doing
something energetically, but her back being
turned to the Health Officer and the Blue Birds,
they could not see what it was that so occupied
her time and attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s dat gals&#8217; name&mdash;out in de brook?&#8221;
Marybell asked one of the six Little Citizens of
the Nest.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s Annie Markey,&#8221; said several voices
obligingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s she standin&#8217; in de crick fer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s scrubbin&#8217; her teet&#8217; like we wuz tol&#8217; to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scrubbin&#8217; her teet&#8217; in all dat water! How
long&#8217;s she been at it?&#8221; wondered Marybell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever since we came back from breakfus&#8217;, cuz
she says she was tol&#8217; all dat grey had to come
offen her front teet&#8217;, an&#8217; she can&#8217;t rub it off,&#8221;
explained the oldest of the group.</p>

<p>Marybell hurried down to the creek and called:
&#8220;Annie&mdash;hoh, Annie Markey, come out here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Annie turned and saw the Officer beckoning
her. She came up on the bank, and Marybell saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
she held a bit of broken mirror in one hand and
the brand-new toothbrush in the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open yer mout&#8217;,&#8221; said Marybell.</p>

<p>Annie obeyed&mdash;it opened widely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back teet&#8217; all gone&mdash;nuttin&#8217; but holes left
dere! Now skin yer teet&#8217;&mdash;like dis!&#8221; And Marybell
showed two rows of sharp front teeth as she
wrinkled up her face fearsomely.</p>

<p>Annie imitated the Officer and Marybell
frowned. &#8220;You&#8217;se ain&#8217;t got no kinda teet&#8217; to
clean, nohow! Dey gotta go to a dentis&#8217; an&#8217; be
scoured er pulled&mdash;I don&#8217; know which, but I&#8217;ll
report you to de hospital anyway and let &#8217;em
do what dey says,&#8221; was Marybell&#8217;s terrifying
verdict.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh please don&#8217; report me to a hospital&mdash;please!
An&#8217; I don&#8217; want all my teet&#8217; pulled neider!
I&#8217;ll run away firs&#8217;. I come here to eat all
I kin and have a good time, an&#8217; now yeh wants
to pull out my teet&#8217; an&#8217; I can&#8217;t chew any more!&#8221;
wailed Annie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nah, I don&#8217;t, Annie! I on&#8217;y wants to git out
dem bad ones what will ache, an&#8217; de udders kin
be scoured to git de black off. What made &#8217;em
so bad?&#8221; soothed Marybell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>&#8220;De school-teacher in Harlem says it was
&#8217;cause I eat so much candy&mdash;me fadder keeps a
candy store wid cigars, yeh see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum&mdash;we unnerstan&#8217;&mdash;nuttin&#8217; like trashy
candy to eat up good teet&#8217;!&#8221; declared Marybell,
wisely, for she had just been told a few lessons
prior to this application, about the evil effects of
sweets on the teeth of children.</p>

<p>In the last Nest in the row, Marybell found
that a roof had leaked during a slight shower the
preceding night. The bed-clothes of the bed
standing under the stream of rainwater were
soaked, but so eager was the child to finish its
work and get away that the damp sheets were
used in making up the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say&mdash;you chumps, who made dis bed?&#8221;
shouted Marybell, as the six Little Citizens ran
up to await inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Franzy Bedell&mdash;it&#8217;s her bed!&#8221; cried five
voices in unison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Franzy&mdash;pull off dem beddings!&#8221; ordered the
Officer.</p>

<p>Franzy slowly removed the covers and exposed
a large damp place at the foot of the mattress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diden&#8217; yeh know any better! Why, even in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Rivington er Ludlow Streets, de mudders know
better&#8217;n use soaked beddin&#8217;. Ye git a black mark
fer dat!&#8221; exclaimed the captain of the squad.</p>

<p>Franzy said nothing but awaited further punishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now spread each artick&#8217;l out on somethin&#8217;
to dry an&#8217; don&#8217;t yeh dare make dat bed till dey
is good an&#8217; dry&mdash;you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;sm!&#8221; quickly said Franzy, glad to get
off so easy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m comin&#8217; back, remember, so don&#8217;t yeh
cheat again!&#8221; And with that threat, Marybell
led the Blue Birds away.</p>

<p>On the way back to the Infirmary where
Marybell had to hand in her reports, she said:
&#8220;Sometimes dem ninnies jus&#8217; pull de bed-covers
up an&#8217; smooth &#8217;em out, tryin&#8217; to fool me to thinkin&#8217;
dey was all aired and made fresh, but I kin
tell! Yep, I kin tell every time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else do you have to watch, Marybell?&#8221;
asked Ruth, who was highly interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, some of de kids wear clo&#8217;es what is
dirty or damp from the brook, an&#8217; I has to make
&#8217;em change er report &#8217;em. Lots of dese East
Siders can&#8217;t see good, an&#8217; lots got somethin&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
wrong wid dere noses an&#8217; t&#8217;roats. I has to watch
ef dey breat&#8217; hard. Den I tells de nurse at de
infirmary an&#8217; she makes tests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess there&#8217;ll be a lot of better children going
back home after this summer,&#8221; mused Vene,
seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and it&#8217;s too bad the city can&#8217;t let girls
like Marybell take charge of certain school departments
just as she is doing here at camp,&#8221;
said Ruth.</p>

<p>Marybell now reported to the superior at the
Infirmary, and the Blue Birds waited outside for
her reappearance. Meantime, the Bobolinks
were entertained by the Captain of the Street
Cleaning Squad.</p>

<p>&#8220;We begin on Primrose Lane&mdash;dat runs down
de middle of de camp-ground. One Member goes
down Violet Lane while anudder goes down Daffodil
Lane. Each member of the Squad has his
own streets to take care of&mdash;dere all called by
flower lanes and paths, but we fellers call &#8217;em
streets like dey do in Noo York, yeh know!&#8221;</p>

<p>While the Squad was collecting the rubbish
that was placed outside each Nest in the morning,
the Captain showed the boys how they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
worked for promotion. A Captain held his office
two weeks and at the expiration of his term, if
he was worthy, he was given a medal for service.
Any boy holding a medal would be allowed to
come to camp the following year. Every boy
in the Squad was eager to be Captain of course,
but such an office was voted upon and decided
by the deportment of the applicant, during his
stay in camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now come over to Farmer Jones&#8217; dump-heap
and I will show you what he does with trash and
debris,&#8221; said the Captain.</p>

<p>As the Bobolinks neared the extreme corner
of the estate far removed from camp and house,
they noticed a disagreeable odor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! You smell our pigs!&#8221; laughed the
Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pigs! Whose pigs?&#8221; chorused the Bobolinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Citizens&#8217; pigs! We are raisin&#8217; a hull
litter of &#8217;em on de leavin&#8217;s of de table. I&#8217;ll show
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bobolinks were soon watching the fat
little porkers who had so much clean food to eat.
All the garbage from the kitchens was carefully
sorted by a few of the Squad each day, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
peelings or bits of raw fruit and vegetables were
thrown into a great kettle near the sty. This
was boiled into mush and fed to the pigs. All
bread, meat and other refuse from table or
kitchen, was mixed well and given to the pigs
at noon. The mushy food was fed in the morning
and at night. The sty was kept as clean
as possible, and the pigs were scrubbed every
day to keep them clean and healthy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness me! Who scrubs them?&#8221; laughed
Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we draw lots for that work. Every feller
in the Squad wants to do it, but we take turns,&#8221;
replied the Captain.</p>

<p>Then he showed the Bobolinks the other refuse
heap. The papers were all picked out and kept
in bags to sell. All rags were also collected for
sale. Tin cans and other metals were picked out
and thrown in a bin for sale also. The money
thus earned was to be used for an outing or for
some form of general good for the Little
Citizens&mdash;such as a victrola, or game, or other
pleasure.</p>

<p>The Bobolinks followed their host back to the
camp and found the Squad had completed their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
rounds and were rolling the little basket-wagons
to the dump. So they said good-by to the captain
and ran away to join the Blue Birds who
were coming from the Infirmary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Uncle Ben has this plan worked down
to a fine system, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; said Ned, approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he has. I&#8217;d like to own one of
those pigs myself, and try for a county-fair
prize,&#8221; said Jinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder he hasn&#8217;t thought of keeping
bee-hives for Little Citizens, or mushroom cellars,
and a lot of other things,&#8221; laughed Meredith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now say, Mete, that bee idea isn&#8217;t so bad.
Let&#8217;s suggest it. Lots of these boys would be
glad to try it out, I should think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll mention it when we get home tonight,&#8221;
said Meredith.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing they&#8217;ve overlooked thus
far, boys,&#8221; said Jinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;what?&#8221; queried the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some scheme to get rid of these mosquitoes
and flies! That always takes the fun out of
camping, I think,&#8221; replied Jinks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;Maybe they have something planned, but it
ought to work. That&#8217;s another item we&#8217;ll ask him
about tonight,&#8221; said Ned.</p>

<p>It happened that night, after everyone was
seated on the piazza of Miss Selina&#8217;s house, that
the topics were mentioned and Uncle Ben had to
admit that he had not yet taken care of ridding
the camp of flies and mosquitoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what, boys! I wish you&#8217;d take
charge of those two important matters and I&#8217;ll
attend to the bee idea. I believe the care of bees
will help the boys at camp a lot, and give them
honey as well as pastime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do the fly and mosquito business, all
right, Uncle Ben, but we must have crude oil
to sprinkle over the marshy or pool spots in the
woods,&#8221; said Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy enough to secure oil, and whatever else
you may need for the pests,&#8221; agreed Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>So the Bobolinks found an important work to
do while they visited at Happy Hills, and not
only were the Little Citizens more comfortable
thereafter, but they found out how to keep free
of flies and malarial mosquitoes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>THE LITTLE CITIZENS&#8217; PICNIC</small></h2>
</div>

<p>As the time drew near for the large farm-wagons
to arrive at the camp to convey the Little
Citizens to the picnic ground, many eyes kept
turning in the direction of the farm-yard, and
every few moments one could hear a whisper of:
&#8220;When will they come, do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, however, a rumbling was heard and a
great shout went up: &#8220;Here they come! Is
everybody ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; &#8220;Hurry up, everyone!&#8221; and other
calls made the camp sound like Bedlam for a
time. The cook had ordered her assistants to
pack the large baskets with all sorts of goodies,
and these most valuable items of luggage were
safely placed under the high seats of the farm-wagons.</p>

<p>While the men were superintending this work,
some of the boys clambered up on the front seat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
and sat beside the drivers&mdash;quite a post of honor,
too, to sit there! The other Little Citizens piled
in wherever a seat could be found, and soon the
merry, noisy crowd was ready to start.</p>

<p>Meantime the two touring cars had gone on
to find the place and see that all was ready for
the reception of the others.</p>

<p>On the way, the Mother&#8217;s Helpers and &#8220;First
Aides&#8221; had much to do to keep order and peace
in the crowded wagons of happy children.
Finally the lake was seen and a loud clamoring
came from throats eager to have a rough-and-tumble
frolic once more&mdash;such as was common
in the city.</p>

<p>The Police and Firemen forgot their duties in
the general scramble for the boats, of which
there were three.</p>

<p>&#8220;Citizens! Don&#8217;t anyone get into the boats&mdash;I
find they are not water-proof!&#8221; shouted Uncle
Ben through his hand-megaphone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh gee! What&#8217;s the fun of comin&#8217; here if
we can&#8217;t sail?&#8221; grumbled one of the Street Cleaning
Department.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Muller, don&#8217;t you give de Boss any sass,
now, er I&#8217;ll lock yeh up fer de day!&#8221; threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
a Policeman, roused to an abnormal sense of
duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s givin&#8217; him sass! Can&#8217;t a feller ask
a question widdout de police buttin&#8217; in?&#8221; complained
Jakey Muller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dass all right! Jest don&#8217;t say nawthin&#8217;, see!&#8221;
returned the Policeman, as he hurried away to
watch a base-ball drawing for pitcher and batter
in the forthcoming game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Think ye&#8217;re smart &#8217;cause yuh got
on a blue uniform. Ef I wants to sail de boat,
I does, so there!&#8221; mumbled Jakey to himself, as
he watched the Policeman disappear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigh, Jakey&mdash;come on over and see the
fun!&#8221; now called a friend a short distance away.</p>

<p>The discontented boy turned and saw some
friends waiting for the farm-hands to finish putting
up some fine swings, but such a tame form
of sport failed to attract the Little Citizen, who
had determined to ride in a boat or do nothing
at all.</p>

<p>Soon after this a score or more of children
were having lots of fun swinging and being the
motive-power back of the swings, for &#8220;pushing&#8221;
the others so high that they would scream in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
dread of falling was more delight than being in
the swing screaming!</p>

<p>A group of Little Citizens were paddling in
the edge of the pond, watched over by Little
Mothers and a few grown-ups. A group went
exploring up the hillside, feeling sure that a
bear&#8217;s cave, or perhaps, the secret home of the
Wood Nymphs would be found on the expedition.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben and some of his helpers were
clearing away the brush and stones that were
in the way of a smooth eating-spot. The grass
must be clean and level, for dinner to be safely
served there. The boys were wildly applauding
a &#8220;home-run&#8221; and some of the riders in the
swings were &#8220;letting the old cat die,&#8221; when
Jakey stepped into a boat just to sit down and
rock it for fun!</p>

<p>A crowd of little girls were playing &#8220;drop the
handkerchief&#8221; and other outdoor games, when
Jakey felt lonely in the boat. He decided to ask
others to join him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, H&#8217;lena Bissel&mdash;come on over and sit by
me&mdash;it&#8217;s lots of fun rockin&#8217; t&#8217; boat!&#8221; called he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;Mister Uncle Ben told us not to an&#8217; I won&#8217;t!&#8221;
called back Helena.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t then! Sugar-lump!&mdash;sugar-lump, too
good to melt!&#8221; taunted Jakey, making a grimace
at the little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t &#8216;sugar ner spice&#8217; but you&#8217;re nuttin&#8217; but
&#8216;snails an&#8217; puppy-dog tails,&#8217; so!&#8221; jeered Helena,
who had heard the Mother Goose line and wanted
to repeat it at the first occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma&#8217;s pet! Mamma&#8217;s pet&mdash;what can&#8217;t do
what she wants cuz she&#8217;s too goody-good!&#8221; replied
Jakey, turning his back upon the angry
little girl.</p>

<p>Helena marched away from his company, and
soon Jakey saw Maggie&#8217;s little sister Prunel with
nothing to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and play wid me, Prunel,&#8221; coaxed he,
not mentioning the boat this time as it seemed
to inspire his hearers with doubt and fear.</p>

<p>Prunel (where Maggie had found the name is
hard to say) was really named Polly, but such
harsh sounds could not be tolerated by Mother
Maggie, and when she took control of the six
younger sisters and brothers, she saw to it that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
each one had a beautiful name, thus Polly became
Prunel.</p>

<p>Prunel was about seven and very energetic
for her age. It took much of Maggie&#8217;s time and
thought to keep Prunel out of mischief at Happy
Hills. In the city, Prunel had to attend school
and look after a short route of newspaper deliveries
after school.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;che playin&#8217;, Jakey?&#8221; asked Prunel, coming
over to the lake-side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh I&#8217;m a navy battle-ship and dat submarine&#8217;s
tryin&#8217; to blow me up. I am shootin&#8217; him
all to pieces, see?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he explained, Jakey aimed stone after
stone at the nearest boat while he stood balancing
himself in the other boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I be the German what shoots the torpedo?&#8221;
asked Prunel, all intense interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw, you git in wid me and both of us kin
sink him, I guess,&#8221; replied Jakey.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be half as much fun as if we had
someone to really fight,&#8221; suggested Prunel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got a fine idea&mdash;you jus&#8217; get in here quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>So Prunel, without knowing it had been forbidden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
got in the boat with Jakey, eager to hear
his plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to break dis rope what holds the
boat, yeh see, an&#8217; float around both dose submarines
by holdin&#8217; fast to dese overhanging
branches, see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you let go on &#8217;em&mdash;cuz yeh hain&#8217;t got
no rope er oars to get back wid,&#8221; warned Prunel,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you t&#8217;ink I&#8217;m such a silly?&#8221; said Jakey, as
the boat swung about to the great excitement of
both sailors.</p>

<p>It bumped into the end of the other boat, and
the children laughed gayly as Jakey said:
&#8220;Maybe I diden&#8217; jar dat Hun dat trip, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be heaps more fun if you&#8217;d get in
anudder boat and play shoot at mine. I could
fire back, and we could see which one gets hit
t&#8217; most&mdash;den he would be sunk, you know!&#8221; said
Prunel.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds good&mdash;say, you keep in dis boat
while I jump in dat one. You&#8217;ve got a lot of
stones left but I kin get some from the bank in a
minute,&#8221; consented Jakey.</p>

<p>Jakey went to the end of the boat and stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
upon the prow waiting for an opportunity to
spring over into the adjoining boat. This was
easy to do, and soon he jumped and landed safely
in the bottom of the flat boat, but the impetus
he used when springing sent the other boat out
from under him and Prunel, being alone and
without any hold on willow-branch or rope, was
floated out from shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Jakey Muller&mdash;hurry out and get me
back!&#8221; called Prunel, but not loud enough for
the others to hear, as she knew it was not just
what she should have done without asking permission.</p>

<p>&#8220;S-sh! Wait a minute! I&#8217;ll wade out and
pull you back!&#8221; replied Jakey, in a low voice also.</p>

<p>He sat down and pulled off his sandals and
stockings, but the boat had caught the edge of
the current that made a channel quite near shore
at this spot of the lake.</p>

<p>He endeavored to reach the end of the boat
but it eluded his hand. Then he waded deeper
and tried again, still the boat moved outward and
Prunel was becoming frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh pshaw&mdash;I gotta jump fer it!&#8221; growled
Jakey, and at that he reached quickly while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
taking a far-advanced step. His foot went in a
hole, and he fell face downward into the lake.
The boat sped onward now faster, as it felt the
carrying tide of the current.</p>

<p>Before Jakey could regain his footing and
splutter out the water that choked him and
blinded his eyes, Prunel was at least fifty feet
from shore. She had remained perfectly quiet
until now, thinking Jakey would surely rescue
her. But when she saw him fall, and get up
again without hope of reaching her, she began
to whimper with fear.</p>

<p>Jakey took a last look at her and with fear in
his eyes as he thought of his disobedience,
he turned to run away from the picnic grove&mdash;even
if he had to run all the way back to the
city. He could not face Uncle Ben&#8217;s stern rebuke,
for he was sure he would be properly
scolded and punished for breaking a law.</p>

<p>Had not Maggie seen a boat with one passenger
skim out in the direction of the old grist-mill,
Prunel might have met with more serious
disaster than that which befell her craft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looka dere, Miss Marting! A little girl is
out in a boat alone,&#8221; called Maggie to her friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>&#8220;Why&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Miss Martin quickly glanced
at Maggie before completing her sentence.</p>

<p>But Maggie, too, saw a resemblance to Prunel.
She hurriedly hunted about amongst the
groups of children, and not finding her sister
anywhere, she shouted to one of the Policemen.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Miss Martin, understanding
the situation, ran to tell Uncle Ben what had
happened to Prunel. He called upon the Police
and Firemen nearest him and all ran to the place
where the three boats had been tied but a short
time before.</p>

<p>Here they saw Jakey wading from the water
and taking to his heels so the Policeman who
had warned him cried: &#8220;Now what&#8217;che gone
and done?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jakey trembled from head to foot as he was
caught and brought back to Uncle Ben. Then he
explained how the accident had happened to Prunel.
As he hurriedly described the scene, the
Police found that neither boat had any oars so
pursuit to bring back the water-waif in that way
was out of the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can anyone swim dat far?&#8221; questioned one of
the firemen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;Not in fresh water&mdash;I kin swim anywhere in
salt water,&#8221; returned one of the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe de boat&#8217;ll float in to shore down furder.
Mister Uncle Ben, dere&#8217;s a finger of land
runs out way down, you see!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is also a mill-race just the other
side of that finger of land, and the current to the
mill runs mighty fast about that jutting bank.
If the boat doesn&#8217;t come in or isn&#8217;t caught before
it reaches that place it is impossible to say what
may be the consequences. An old water-wheel
turns the mill and the race feeds the wheel. The
child is in danger out there with no means of
helping herself and we are here with no way to
reach her,&#8221; said Uncle Ben, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all the excitement&mdash;anyone fall overboard?&#8221;
called Jinks, coming up and asking his
question laughingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Prunel is afloat in that boat&mdash;see her
down the lake there?&#8221; replied Mete, who was
standing beside Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott! And all of you standing around
here doing nothing?&#8221; cried Jinks, scornfully, running
away to the squad of Police who were still
umpiring the last game of ball.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>&#8220;Hey there! Dutchy&mdash;did you bring your
dog?&#8221; yelled Jinks, when he had covered half the
distance between the two groups.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh! Why?&#8221; came back the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Jinks going to do with the dog?&#8221;
asked Uncle Ben, starting to run after the boy,
and thus starting all the other boys on the ground
running after him. Inside of a minute the long
line of boys running, looked like a thriller in a
moving-picture play.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave it to Jinks to think up some way of
rescue!&#8221; called Ned and Mete, panting beside
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember that fire we went to when we were
on the Canal trip?&#8221; added Don, who came just
too late to do all the talking to Jinks.</p>

<p>Before the crowd of curious boys reached the
spot where Jinks had hurriedly explained the
situation to Bill, the two boys and a few of the
ball-players had started off along the shore, calling
and whistling to the great mongrel dog that
was Bill&#8217;s beloved and particular care.</p>

<p>The shaggy, tawny hound came crashing from
the bushes with tail wagging joyously at the unusual
outing he was given that day. When Bill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
saw him, he snapped his fingers and called excitedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Crummie go in and fetch! Fetch it out, good
ol&#8217; doggie!&#8221; and at the same time, he threw a
stone far out into the lake to attract the dog&#8217;s attention
to the water.</p>

<p>Crummie went in ker-splash and swam about
for a short time looking for the object which
his master had thrown for him to bring out
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Dutchy, Prunel is too far out for the
dog to reach&mdash;let&#8217;s run along shore till we get to
the finger over there. You see, the current runs
quite close in to shore there and we can send
Crummie out from that spot. Maybe we can
tie a rope to his collar and let him swim out with
it to the boat, then we can pull the girl in to
shore,&#8221; quickly explained Jinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine! Say you, Dink Brown&mdash;run back and
get a rope er somethin&#8217; fer us, will you? We&#8217;ll
be down on that finger waitin&#8217; fer you. Mebbe
we kin shout an&#8217; make the kid hear what we want
her to do,&#8221; replied Bill.</p>

<p>Before he had completed his sentence, Dink
was running back to Uncle Ben to ask for a rope.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Then the other boys with the dog ran swiftly
away to the spot Jinks had designated.</p>

<p>As they ran, Jinks found a section of newspaper
on the pathway, and this he caught up and
began rolling into a long tube.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s &#8217;at fer?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make a megaphone for us to call through,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Big idea! Make it wide at the open end so&#8217;s
she can git the call better. If you make it narrow
the sound won&#8217;t go out so clear, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the finger of land, Jinks stood out on a
large rock and shouted and shouted at Prunel
who was crying fearfully and kneeling in the bottom
of the boat while clinging to the oar-lock.</p>

<p>At the echo of Jinks&#8217; call she looked about but
did not at first see the boys standing where the
channel curved in towards land. At the second
shout, however, she looked in the direction from
which the sound came, and stopped wailing as
she saw the group of police waiting to assist her.</p>

<p>Then she heard her name called and listened
to what was said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to send the dog out to the boat&mdash;you
call &#8216;Here Crummie! here Crummie!&#8217; as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
soon as he goes in the water. He will come to
you and then you will find a rope tied to his collar.
Fasten the rope to the ring in the boat and
we will haul you in!&#8221;</p>

<p>It needed several trials before Prunel understood
the plan, but once she did it was all right,
although the boat was fast reaching the place
where the current flowed in towards land so the
dog had to hurry out with the rope if it was to
work as planned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I come&mdash;get him ready!&#8221; called the boy
who had been sent for the rope.</p>

<p>The boys turned and saw him racing along
with a long coil of swing rope that had been
hastily cut down to use. Dink, being the swiftest
runner in camp, was soon back with the Police
and Jinks.</p>

<p>One end of the rope was tied to Crummie&#8217;s old
leather collar and then he was sent in to bring
out Prunel. At the same time Jinks shouted
through the megaphone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Call him, Prunel! Call him, again and again,
till he reaches you with the rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they heard the little girl cry excitedly:
&#8220;Here Crummie! Here Crummie!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;See her over there, Crummie? Fetch her out!
Fetch her out, I say! Go get it&mdash;get it&mdash;good
doggie!&#8221; coaxed Bill.</p>

<p>And Crummie, sniffing over the water, saw
the approaching boat and heard the child&#8217;s cry
for help. Instantly the yellow dog understood
what was required of him and in he went, dragging
the long line of rope after him.</p>

<p>The boys on shore held their breath so the
dog would not be confused, and Prunel kept on
calling, &#8220;Here Crummie! Here Crummie! Good
dog&mdash;come to me, Crummie!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the dog swam as fast as he could in a
direct line for the object he saw on the surface
of the lake. He came within five feet of it when
it swept past him in the current now running
fast to the mill-race.</p>

<p>Groans and cries on shore showed that more
than one anxious group were watching the efforts
of the brave dog. But Crummie was of
the nature that resents failure or trickery. He
was of the dogged kind that will fight harder in
spite of all obstacles, and perseverance and persistence
always win out!</p>

<p>Crummie kept on swimming after the boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
while Prunel continued calling and pleading, and
the boys on the bank kept on anxiously letting
the rope out and wondering if it was long enough
to reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, Jinks, it&#8217;s the end!&#8221; gasped Bill.</p>

<p>And just as Jinks was about to give up in despair,
one of the other boys yelled: &#8220;By golly!
Crummie&#8217;s got hold of the rope that dragged
after the boat!&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone strained their eyes to see, and sure
enough the dog had caught hold of the rope that
had tied the boat to the bank and was swimming
back the way he came against the current.</p>

<p>The struggling animal was not making much
headway against the swift stream and Jinks instantly
saw that he would tire himself out and
be useless, so he signaled to Bill, and the two
ran through the bushes growing on the shore and
reached a place opposite the boat. Then Jinks
called again to the dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Crummie! Crummie, come in here!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the strange voice, the dog stopped battling
against the current but did not turn. However,
Bill saw through Jinks&#8217; idea and quickly abetted
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>&#8220;Here, good old Crummie! Fetch it home!
Fetch it home!&#8221;</p>

<p>And at his master&#8217;s well-known call, the dog
turned and swam for shore where the two boys
were waiting to help. Jinks pulled off his shoes
and stockings, rolled up his trousers and waded
in as far as he could. When Crummie came
within arm&#8217;s reach, Jinks leaned out to catch hold
of the rope, but the dog growled fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, ha! Crummie won&#8217;t let you interfere!
He don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re after&mdash;mebbe
you want to take away the prize he&#8217;s bringin&#8217; in
to me!&#8221; laughed Bill, delightedly, now that the
strain was over.</p>

<p>Even Jinks laughed at the treatment he had
been given by the dog, but Crummie dragged the
rope straight up to his master and left it in his
hands. Then it was seen that the rope that had
been tied to the old collar had torn it away and
was out in the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;When did the swing rope break?&#8221; asked Don,
who failed to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon after the strain came on it, most likely,&#8221;
said Mete.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I think!&#8221; ventured Uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
Ben, who had hurried up with Maggie, and now
stood patting Crummie&#8217;s wet, matted head.</p>

<p>The children all looked at him for an opinion,
and he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that Crummie would have gone for
that boat and found his own way to drag it back
to land, whether any of you boys had interfered
with him or not. Now, seeing that our hero dog
lost his neck-band in his effort to save a life, I
shall award him the medal for bravery this
month. Anyone opposing this motion say &#8216;No!&#8217;;
if there is no opposition and everyone agrees with
me that Crummie shall have the prize let us all
say &#8216;Aye!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a tremendous shout of &#8220;Ayes&#8221; went out
instantly, that Crummie was unanimously voted
the hero for the month, and Bill was the proudest
boy in camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the prize going to be, Uncle Ben?&#8221;
asked Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh something that Crummie will appreciate
and everyone will stop to admire and read. I&#8217;m
thinking a wonderful studded collar with his
name and the story of the rescue engraved on a
silver plate might be suitable.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;Oh yes&mdash;yes, indeed!&#8221; chorused most of the
Blue Birds and Bobolinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, Uncle Ben, spend a lot of money on it to
make it as big and shiny as you can,&#8221; advised
Dot Starr.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much money do you think will do?&#8221;
asked Uncle Ben, teasingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know how much a funeral for Prunel
would have cost if Crummie hadn&#8217;t saved
her life, so you might as well spend that much
anyway,&#8221; replied Dot in all seriousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve got an idea!&#8221; cried Don, inspired by
his twin&#8217;s words. &#8220;Have it tell on the collar that
the prize is a souvenir of a watery grave that was
never filled by the saved child &#8217;cause Crummie
was here to fly to the rescue&mdash;you might say
&#8216;swim&#8217; to the rescue, only it doesn&#8217;t sound as
grand as &#8216;fly.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone laughed heartily at Don&#8217;s suggestion,
and Ned said: &#8220;Don&#8217;s growing a streak
of poesy and we all had better beware or he&#8217;ll
rhyme us into jingles some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don scorned such ideas, and after giving Ned
a meaning look, he said: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be anything
so silly as a jingler like Ned Talmage is!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
I&#8217;m going to buy Crummie and start a kennel of
fine life-saving dogs to send to the Allies! So
there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! that&#8217;s why Don wants Uncle Ben to
spend all that funeral money on a collar. He&#8217;ll
sell the collar and keep the money to found the
kennels!&#8221; laughed Mete, in a big brother&#8217;s tone
of voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you kids! Don&#8217;t fool yourselves on dat
score! Dis dog is mine and he stays mine till
the las&#8217; trumpet blows&mdash;see!&#8221; was the last word
from Crummie&#8217;s master, and the yellow dog
wagged his tail approvingly as he blinked up into
Bill&#8217;s blue-green eyes.</p>

<small>MISS MARTIN&#8217;S NATURE STORIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The picnic was declared a grand success in
spite of the fright little Prunel had had, for such
a thrill as the Little Citizens had been treated to
at the danger and escape of one of their members
was not to be had every day! So that event
added glory to the occasion and was one long to
be remembered.</p>

<p>The day after the outing, most of the Little
Citizens were seated at the Auditorium (as they
called the Refectory when other occasions demanded
its use) waiting for the Blue Birds who
had promised to come and hear Miss Martin&#8217;s
nature story that day.</p>

<p>Miss Martin was seen coming from her Nest
and soon after she had greeted the children, the
Blue Birds were heard laughing and talking as
they hurried down Harebell Road.</p>

<p>When all were seated Miss Martin began:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you about some pests we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
have in camp, and your Uncle Ben agreed to be
present so he could hear what a nuisance they
are. I see him coming from the Fire-house so
he will soon be here. Before he arrives, however,
I want to ask you children a favor. When
my story is finished I shall call upon you to ask
how many will volunteer to work in the Health
Department for a few days to get rid of flies
and mosquitoes, and I wish everyone here to
offer their services to Uncle Ben.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh we will! You don&#8217;t have to ask us a favor
like that&mdash;we&#8217;d do it anyway!&#8221; replied one of
the Health Inspectors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I late?&#8221; asked Uncle Ben, now coming
over to the group gathered to hear the stories.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just in time,&#8221; replied Ruth, making a place
for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My first story will be about a mosquito that
settled down at Happy Hills and founded the
colony of pests that annoys us so at camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Skinny was a malarial mosquito that happened
to crawl from the reeds near the lake into
a carpenter&#8217;s tool-chest while the man was eating
his lunch late last fall. As his job was completed,
the carpenter caught up the tool-box and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
hurried towards Miss Selina&#8217;s place to leave it in
the tool-house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Skinny was very sleepy because of the cold
air, and the tool-box being left in a snug, sunny
spot on a shelf in the tool-house, she soon fell
asleep for the long cold winter months.</p>

<p>&#8220;But in the spring the warm sun-rays roused
her and she began to open her sleepy eyes and
stretch her stiffened legs; her poor wings she
could not use at once&mdash;they were so nerveless
and stiff that it took some practice to whip them
into general use again. She succeeded somewhat,
just as the carpenter came in and took up
the tool-chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where&#8217;re you goin&#8217; to work, Pete?&#8217; asked
a man standing outside the shed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Down at Happy Hills Camp. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
build some Nests for the Blue Birds&#8217; Little Citizens,
you know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, thar ain&#8217;t no mosquitoes around er no
flies, either, so you won&#8217;t be pestered any, I
guess,&#8217; said the first man, as Pete walked away
down Daffodil Lane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Skinny heard the conversation and smiled.
&#8216;Not a mosquito on the place, eh? Well I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
have to get busy and change that lonesome state
of affairs mighty quick!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So poor Pete carried the little pest along in
his harmless tool-chest, and while he left it standing
in the sunshine until he could find the boss
carpenter, the sun-rays made Skinny feel so lively
that she decided to try her wings and soar a bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was easier than she had thought possible,
so she flew down to a little shallow pool
in the creek for a drink of water. Here she
found a slimy little back-water puddle so warm
and comfortable that she soon chose that spot
for the eggs she proposed laying to found the
mosquito colony of Happy Hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Early the following morning, Mrs. Spot
Toad saw hundreds of oblong-shaped eggs floating
on the slimy pool, but it was none of her business
so she did not report the matter to the
Board of Health as one of the Little Citizens
would have done. In fact Spot was so busy with
her own family cares that she forgot all about
the mosquito larv&aelig; soon after she had seen the
small sooty specks floating on the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Skinny left her eggs to hatch and went her
way rejoicing, but not for long!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;She had hardly reached a tree where a dozing
carpenter tempted her to eat, when a mother
Blue Bird swooped down from her nest and
caught up the lean, lanky mosquito to feed to
her babies. Of course there was no nourishment
in a poor thing like Skinny, but it would help
fill the gaping mouths of the baby-birds a bit!</p>

<p>&#8220;Inside of twenty-four hours, Skinny&#8217;s eggs
began to hatch out, but they were not mosquitoes&mdash;they
were wrigglers. In appearance they resembled
wooly, little caterpillars, but one end of
the squirming body was the breathing tube for
air. The fuzzy part of the wriggler was the
means of its moving about, and they all wriggled
or jerked about continually. Some grew faster
than others, but all grew very fast, their heads
seeming to grow faster than their bodies.</p>

<p>&#8220;In about six days&#8217; time the wrigglers had
grown so strong that they floated on the top of
the water in the hot sunshine, so that the heat
might crack open the skins that enclosed the
young mosquitoes. As one shell opened after
another, the insects crawled out and waited upon
the tops of their little boats to dry their wings
and legs. The sun soon accomplished this work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
and then the hundreds of young mosquitoes were
flying about waiting for an opportunity to eat
something good.</p>

<p>&#8220;About this time the first Little Citizens appeared
at Camp, and many of the children ran
down to the creek to play in the water. Of course
Skinny&#8217;s family sniffed the sweet young blood of
the children there, and many a young mosquito
ate till it almost burst open, and the Little Citizen
had an irritating bite on arms or legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many, many of the young mosquitoes remained
near the creek and laid eggs for a new
family, and others flew away to the puddles in
the woods, or settled on the eaves of the roof
where rainwater had left tiny pools. Others saw
the lake, and still others found water in pails or
bottles and vessels of all sorts. In a very short
time every one of Skinny&#8217;s children was laying a
multitude of eggs that would hatch out in a day
or two, and in ten to twelve days there would be a
pest of mosquitoes at Happy Hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the time Little Citizens were running
about these woods, playing, or digging by the
creek, or making mud-pies from the soft mud in
the little pools, thousands and thousands of nasty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
mosquitoes were flying and humming everywhere,
while hundreds of thousands were being
hatched from the wrigglers that had been the
outcome of eggs laid by every mosquito in the
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally the Little Citizens had such itching
red spots on their bodies, and so many of the
younger children had to keep away from the
fascinating little brook because of the pesky,
stinging insects, that Uncle Ben said something
must be done at once to rid Happy Hills of this
menace.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what can we do to so many? If we have
to catch every wriggler or mosquito about Happy
Hills, it will take ten times the number of Little
Citizens here to catch and kill them&mdash;and then
there will be thousands of insects left to breed
new pests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but there is a way that will smother all
the young and kill the old mosquitoes! Now listen
carefully!</p>

<p>&#8220;We will get kerosene or crude oil, and pour
a little on the surface of the water wherever
we think a mosquito has laid her eggs.
While we are doing it, we will oil all the still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
waters so no mosquito will dare to settle anywhere
and lay new eggs.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see the oil will spread out over the surface
of the water and keep the wrigglers from
getting air for their bodies&mdash;this will soon
smother them and they will sink to the bottom
of the pool, dead! The old mosquitoes that
should come to visit the pond or pools, will light
upon the glassy, oiled water and instantly find it
impossible to remove their hairy legs; besides,
their noses will be filled with the fumes and soon
choke them so that they, too, will sink down to
the bottom of the stagnant pool or float dead
upon the oil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy Hills will then become a comfortable
place at night and a more enjoyable camp for
the children at day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Martin concluded her first story and the
children showed their interest by the many questions
they asked. Among other things, she was
asked if there was more than one kind of mosquito,
and this brought up an explanation of the
difference between the malarial mosquito and the
simply poisonous, stinging kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mosquito that causes malaria by its bite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
can be detected if you see it sting, for it always
stings with head pointed downward and its tail
and hind legs held straight up in the air. The
common mosquito stands with its body on a horizontal
line when it stings, but both kinds are
poisonous and are of no use whatever. The
sooner the country is cleared of such plagues the
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done a good work, Miss Martin, by
telling us how to rid the camp of mosquitoes. I
ordered several barrels of unrefined petroleum
oil and Jones told me this morning that they are
at the freight station. He is there now with a
wagon to bring them back. When he comes, we
will all start in with cans and anything we can
find to hold oil, to hunt mosquitoes,&#8221; remarked
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another pest to be gotten rid of, Mr.
Talmage,&#8221; suggested Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;And have you a story ready for it?&#8221; laughed
Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t take a moment to weave one just
as long as we may need for the occasion,&#8221; replied
Miss Martin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>&#8220;Is it the fly that you have such an antipathy
to?&#8221; continued Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is, and if you will do as I advise,
Happy Hills will soon be rid of flies as well as
mosquitoes,&#8221; rejoined Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, tell us a story and we will judge of
the importance of the battle against the fly,&#8221; said
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>So Miss Martin sat thinking for a few seconds
before she began:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, Flossy, did you know Uncle Ben Talmage
has started a camp at Happy Hills for the
Little Citizens?&#8217; cried a noisy fly to her companion
one nice day in June.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Really! How interesting; but what good
will that do us here? We are keeping house in
the pig&#8217;s trough, so how could we hope to reach
camp so far away?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll tell you about a plan I have, Flossy. Of
course, there will be lots of children staying
the summer at Happy Hills, and where there are
little ones there is sure to be food and things
lying about for flies to picnic upon. Now we
can steal a ride from the pig-sty to the camp
when Farmer Jones feeds the pigs. We can sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
in the bottom of his swill-cans and sneak into
camp without anyone seeing us. Once there we
can set up housekeeping at any of the Nests.
Soon we will have a large family and found a
great fly-colony.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How wise you are, Noisy! Let us sit in the
dark corner and wait for the farmer&#8217;s can,&#8217; replied
Flossy, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the two flies were carried from the smelly
pig-sty to the nice clean, brand-new Nest built
for Miss Martin and her Little Citizens. But
Miss Martin didn&#8217;t know the two wicked flies
had arrived to live in her Nest.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one knew the two flies were perched on
the edges of the milk-glasses with their filthy,
fuzzy legs and feet, and leaving all kinds of foreign
matter on the glass rim where little babies&#8217;
lips would soon sip the milk! Neither did anyone
know that one of the pesky flies had just
deposited its filth on a slice of buttered bread for
one of the children. But so it happened just the
same!</p>

<p>&#8220;There had been a few other flies in the pig-sty
when the two adventurers started forth, and they
too decided to follow their friends. So a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
of dirty insects caught hold of the horse&#8217;s legs
and belly and thus were brought to camp. Here
they sought out Flossy and Noisy and suggested
that they all go to housekeeping together.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where shall we set up housekeeping?&#8217; asked
Noisy.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, when we rode into camp on old Dobbin,
we passed by the stables. There are a number
of choice apartments about the building, and
I located one in the manure heap outside. Another
good flat-house is over where the dump-ground
is. We can always find decaying fruit
or rotting stuff there,&#8217; returned one of the new
arrivals.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Flossy and her husband started housekeeping
in the dump-ground, while Noisy and her
spouse settled in the manure heap by the barns.
Noisy crawled about over the damp straws that
had been swept out from the stable-stalls and
soon found a fine spot to deposit her eggs.</p>

<p>&#8220;That evening Noisy and her husband flew
back to camp to visit Little Citizens and see what
they could do to interfere with the wholesome
plans of Uncle Ben and Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hundreds of tiny white eggs laid in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
manure heap by Mother Noisy, as her first brood
of children for that summer, and the hundreds
laid by Flossy in the dump-heap to found her big
family, began instantly to hatch out into queer
worm-like creatures. In less than twenty-four
hours a swarm of these pests were stirring about
as lively as could be, and in less than a day after
they were hatched from the eggs, they cast off
their skins. It took another day for them to shed
a second coat, and then a day or two later they
got rid of a third skin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now they looked like little oval grubs that
remained as quiet as if there was no life within
them, but at the end of a week, the shells cracked
open and a multitude of young flies crept out to
fly away just as Noisy did from the pig-sty where
she was born.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thousands of flies hatched out of the
manure heap and dumping-ground now feasted
on all the filth and decaying mess they could find
and soon they were laying eggs wherever a
smelly dirty spot could be found, because flies
prefer filth to cleanliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thousands more hatched from these eggs and
in three generations of flies, and in three weeks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>&#8217;
time, there were millions of horrid pests flying
about camp. Millions buzzed in our ears and
slapped their dirty wings in our faces. Millions
crept over our food leaving the nasty trails of
their hairy feet everywhere&mdash;but so fine a dirt
that we could not see it with our naked eyes.
There were millions to bite baby&#8217;s sweet rosy lip,
to tickle our noses with their fuzzy legs and
tails, to drop into the butter, or swim about in
our water and milk, always leaving their filth
as a mark of their nuisance!</p>

<p>&#8220;Then along came the man with the barrels of
oil from the station, and the pools and damp
places about camp were soon saturated with kerosene.
It was noticed that the flies kept away
from such spots.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Suppose we try oil on the hatching places
of the flies, Miss Martin?&#8217; asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It will kill the eggs anyway, and may catch
some of the flies. But we can keep everything
securely covered and screened so a fly will have
to starve and then be forced to eat from the
poisoned saucer filled with water. Soon we can
kill off all the old flies and with the breeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
spots disinfected there will be no flies to sicken
us,&#8217; replied Miss Martin, and so it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Citizens hated the flies almost as much
as did Miss Martin and the other grown-ups at
Happy Hills, and as soon as the oil-barrels were
opened and ready for use, everyone started out
to find breeding nests of flies and soak them well
with oil.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what a lovely summer the rest of that
season was at camp, without flies or mosquitoes
to annoy the very life out of one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! That&#8217;s a better story than the first!
Here comes Jones with the farm-wagon bringing
in the barrels! Come on, Police and Health
Board&mdash;to work to rid the camp of pests!&#8221;</p>

<p>At Bill&#8217;s call to Little Citizens, they jumped
up and hurriedly thanking Miss Martin for her
stories, ran off to meet the driver with the oil-cans.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that is one way to plant ambition for
better conditions,&#8221; sighed Miss Martin, feeling
she had invested her half-hour to some good purpose.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>THE AMUSEMENT COMPANY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The next few days were very busy ones for
the Little Citizens, but the comfort and peace
about camp was remarked by everyone, especially
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare, I never dreamed flies and mosquitoes
could make folks so miserable and irritable
with each other!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that those two pests are diminishing, I
wish to mention another cause of impatience and
concern in camp. The boys and girls past the
age of eight or nine, who are not actively engaged
with the Police, Firemen, or other departments
established at Happy Hills, really need
something to occupy their thoughts and time. In
the city they have so many ways of working or
entertaining themselves&mdash;often detrimental, too,
that time begins to hang heavily on their hands
now that the novelty of country-life is wearing
off,&#8221; explained Miss Martin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know of anything more we can
do to keep them busy,&#8221; replied Uncle Ben, with
an anxious frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have an idea and it may work out to the
benefit and amusement of everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to try anything you say,&#8221; returned
Uncle Ben, encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us start &#8216;An Amusement Company.&#8217;
Elect managers of the different departments and
&#8216;stars&#8217; and &#8216;supers&#8217; and have the Band furnish
music. If you think well of my idea we may
even go so far as to reward the actors and musicians
who entertain us best. Let it be known
that this company is formed more as a means
of starting various contests for music, oratory,
and acting, and is open for all entries, young,
aged, small or large citizens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Who is there to teach them such
things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not believe the street children of a large
city need much teaching in entertaining. They
are so precocious and experienced from their life
in general, that they only need suggestions to
boost their ideas,&#8221; laughed Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it will cost us nothing to try out your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
idea anyway, and no harm will be done if it
fails to inspire your performers as you think
it will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I know just what you think, Mr. Talmage!
You are secretly laughing at the failure
you are sure will follow this endeavor,&#8221; retorted
Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really hope you will not be disappointed in
your high appraisal of these city children&#8217;s brilliant
possibilities,&#8221; returned Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see! If you will find some sort of a
&#8216;drop-curtain&#8217; even if it does not drop&mdash;we can
draw it on rings slipped over a pole; and a raised
stage, it will be all I shall ask of you. The stage
can be a bare platform raised about two feet
above the Refectory floor. It can be built on a
rough framework, and take little time or cost to
construct.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will get some of the older boys to help me
build it, and the Bobolink Boys will revel in sawing
and hammering, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, you announce the new society to
Little Citizens and have all who wish to enter
the contests register with me during the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
three days, and I will examine each one to find
what each one is capable of doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Ben smiled indulgently at what he believed
to be Miss Martin&#8217;s mistaken judgment,
and agreed to call the Little Citizens together
that evening to tell them of the plan for their
amusement.</p>

<p>The plan for starting an amusement company
met with great approval as was shown in various
ways, and the next morning Miss Martin was
sought by those who wished to join the new club.
In fact some of the children appeared at her Nest
before breakfast so as to be listed in parts they
hoped to fill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children, suppose you wait until I have had
something to eat and then we will go into this
work,&#8221; laughed Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you let anyone take our place&mdash;remember
we came first!&#8221; warned several voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Nest will be too small to hold you all so
I suggest that we use a folding-table as a desk
and find some secluded spot in the grove where
we will be away from the confusion of camp
work. If one has to be tried out in any line he
can perform without feeling embarrassed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
others watching or hearing him,&#8221; said Miss Martin,
to the group waiting anxiously for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll carry the folding-table over when you&#8217;re
ready to go!&#8221; quickly offered Bill, who had an
idea of what he would do in the new company.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll take the chair!&#8221; added Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, boys; now let us have breakfast
and do our camp chores&mdash;then we will be ready
to begin our fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>Camp work was through sooner than ever that
morning and before ten o&#8217;clock Miss Martin was
seated before the impromptu desk in the quiet
shady grove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Molly Brown&mdash;you were so anxious to
sign up this morning&mdash;what can you do to entertain
an audience?&#8221; said Miss Martin, smiling at
the ten-year-old girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kin ride bareback!&#8221; was the startling answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ride bareback&mdash;but what good will that do us
in a show-house?&#8221; gasped Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;se don&#8217;t have to keep yersels to one show,
does you? In Noo York der&#8217;s a theayter an&#8217; a
hippodrome, too!&#8221; was Molly&#8217;s quick reply.</p>

<p>This opened vast possibilities before Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
Martin&#8217;s vision, and before she could collect herself
to speak wisely, one of the boys said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I t&#8217;ink dat&#8217;s a good idee! Lots of us kin do
stunts dat goes wid a hippodrome show what
can&#8217;t be did on a stage in a regerler theayter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then; Molly, will you sit down at
my left hand side where I will place all the circus
actors, and the stage performers can go to my
right,&#8221; said Miss Martin, hastily postponing her
other answer.</p>

<p>Molly sat down upon the grass with a satisfied
manner&mdash;was she not going to be robed in
tarletan and tinsel some day and leap gracefully
from an Arabian horse&#8217;s back, then throw kisses
at an admiring audience? That is how Molly
pictured herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill, what do you propose doing?&#8221; asked the
investigator of the theatrical company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I kin do lots of stunts, but best of all
I kin blow my horn. I will like to stay in de
band wedder you&#8217;se have it for the theayter or fer
de circus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Bill, then I&#8217;ll enter you as cornetist.
But you must practice and render a solo every
now and then for a prize, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, I knows!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill&#8217;s name was entered and he signed himself
as a solo-cornetist in the company. As he was
about to place the pen back on the table he had
a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Marting, why can&#8217;t I enter Crummie
fer a show?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah yes, Miss Martin&mdash;Crummie is a swell
show-dog! He does lots of tricks what oughter
be known by a real circus man; he would get paid
a lot of money fer &#8217;em,&#8221; added several voices
back of Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really! How interesting! Of course we will
enter Crummie with the other actors. He can&#8217;t
sign for himself, but we will let Bill do it,&#8221; explained
Miss Martin.</p>

<p>A chorus of laughter made her look about at
the amused faces, and Bill placed his two fingers
between his lips and gave a shrill whistle. Crummie
had roamed away from the group at the desk
in search of squirrels or chipmunks, but at that
call he came bounding back to his master&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Crummie, Miss Marting says ye can&#8217;t
sign yer name! She t&#8217;inks yer a fool dog an&#8217;
it&#8217;s up t&#8217; you t&#8217; show her she&#8217;s mistaken,&#8221; laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
Bill, delightedly, as he took up the pen he had
laid aside and dipped it in the ink.</p>

<p>Miss Martin instantly suspected the act that
was to be performed for her benefit; that it was
generally known to the other children was evidenced
by the way they laughed when she suggested
that Bill sign for the dog.</p>

<p>Crummie stood upon his hind legs and placed
his fore-paws carefully on the edge of the table.
Then Bill pushed the sheet of paper over under
his nose, and the dog took hold of the pen-handle
with his teeth. By moving his head up and down
and from side to side, he managed to scrawl a
number of circles and lines, then he lifted his
nose high in the air to take the pen-point from
the paper and when he brought it down again
he made a period very near the ending of his
writing.</p>

<p>Everyone laughed and cried &#8220;Good doggie&#8221;
and Miss Martin patted his head as she laughingly
said: &#8220;Crummie is truly a wonder. He is
our first performer for the public pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s nuttin, Miss Marting; Crummie kin do
lots of stunts better&#8217;n dat!&#8221; bragged Bill.</p>

<p>It took some time to assure Crummie that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
need not show off any more of his tricks that
time, as there was too much clerical work to
accomplish to stop for him. But the dog resented
the business-like tone of Miss Martin, and
when she would have removed the pen from his
teeth he wheeled about and ran off to the woods
with it.</p>

<p>Bill gave hot pursuit but Crummie was fleet-footed,
so everyone laughed at the trick the dog
had turned on the company. After a time, Bill
returned with the pen, but it showed signs of
having been through sharp-pointed teeth before
it was recovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was jus&#8217; goin&#8217; to dig a hole and bury it
when I crept up behind and caught hol&#8217; on his
tail. Dat made him open his mouth, y&#8217; know,
and the pen dropped out,&#8221; laughed Bill.</p>

<p>No further unexpected interruptions took
place, so Miss Martin proceeded with the programme
of actors.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your specialty, Jim?&#8221; to a freckle-faced
lad of eleven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me fadder was a champeen clog-dancer in
Dublin, an&#8217; he teached me de dance afore he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
died. I kin clog to beat de band!&#8221; said Jimmy,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh fine! Will you show us a sample of it,
some time?&#8221; replied Miss Martin as she wrote
down Jim&#8217;s accomplishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure, but not on de grass, ye know, Miss
Marting! It needs wood floors and wood clogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and we will have you dance on the Refectory
floor soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>From Jim she went to one of the girls, who
appeared impatient to tell of her talents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Jenny, your turn next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Martin, I kin take off anyone you wants
me to! I does it for fun at home an&#8217; teacher
says I&#8217;m the funniest girl she ever saw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jenny, suppose you impersonate Dinah, the
cook?&#8221; said Miss Martin.</p>

<p>Dinah was a true southerner and spoke with
all the old-time darkey accent. Jenny beamed at
the simple trial given her, and cleared her throat
to begin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yo&#8217; Jenny! Come yeah, Ah say, chile!
Doan yo&#8217; heah yo&#8217; Mammy callin&#8217; yo? Heah
I&#8217;se waitin&#8217; fo&#8217; to carry yo&#8217; ober Jordan an&#8217; yo&#8217;
don&#8217; heah me, nohow!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>Jenny&#8217;s manner and voice, to say nothing of
the expression on her face, was so exactly the
counterpart of Dinah&#8217;s that everyone screamed
with enjoyment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jenny, that is very clever! Can you imitate
my ways as well?&#8221; laughed Miss Martin, after
the fun had subsided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh you&#8217;se is easy to do, but don&#8217;che git mad
at me?&#8221; pleaded Jenny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not, child. It is all done in a spirit
of fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Jenny mimicked Miss Martin to such
perfection that Uncle Ben, who had quietly approached
the group, clapped his hands and
laughed.</p>

<p>Examination went on merrily after Uncle
Ben&#8217;s appearance, and many talents were discovered
in the number of Little Citizens who
applied that morning. And so diversified were
the abilities signed up for, that Miss Martin felt
sure of succeeding not only with a theater company
but with a circus troupe as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have discovered an embryo Buffalo Bill
among the boys, and he will have charge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
lassoing and broncho busting,&#8221; said Miss Martin
looking at her lists.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Molly rides bareback. Several boys are
pugilists and target shooters. With practice they
will be able to take the part of Indians in fighting
and shooting, then we can have the old scene
of Buffalo Bill&#8217;s stage-coach hold-up in the West.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dozen boys wish to form a string orchestra,
and half of the boys here are already interested
in the Brass Band. With all the other talent I
have discovered, I should say we might give an
excellent circus&mdash;lacking only the wild animals
and freaks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I agree to supply the freaks and wild animals
will you promise to produce a good circus
troupe for a show?&#8221; asked Uncle Ben, seriously,
yet his eyes twinkled humorously.</p>

<p>Miss Martin looked steadfastly at him for a
few moments before she said: &#8220;Are you serious?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I am. Don&#8217;t you think the Little
Citizens ought to give an entertainment to all
the friends who have worked so hard to make
this camp a success?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing they&#8217;d rather do, I&#8217;m sure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
than to give a circus. It will be the natural outlet
of much pent up energy,&#8221; laughed Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us have a circus, by all means. We&#8217;ll
get Richards to make an announcement of it to
all the people who are interested in this venture.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was decided to experiment with the talent
at camp, and see if there would be anything to
work on in giving a huge circus to which all
friends and acquaintances would be invited.</p>

<small>THE CIRCUS AT HAPPY HILLS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Mister Uncle Ben, ain&#8217;t che goin&#8217; to ask no
money fer our circus?&#8221; asked Joe Brennan, when
he heard of the entertainment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why no, Joe, this is to be a treat given by
us to the people who did so much for Little Citizens.
It will cost them a lot of money just to get
here, as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey all got autermobiles what dey will use.
Dey don&#8217;t have to buy car-tickets,&#8221; argued Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;The autos use gasoline, you know, and it is
a long ride. Besides, Joe, why do you ask such
a question. The cash taken in wouldn&#8217;t do you
any good?&#8221; wondered Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was t&#8217;inkin&#8217;&mdash;we could start a fund fer dat
city home yeh know&mdash;de one you&#8217;se said oughter
be run fer Little Citizens. I ain&#8217;t got no home
to live in when I gets back to Noo York and it&#8217;s
cold in winter, lemme tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe, I am going to take up that very subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
with these people when they get here and show
them the good that home-life has done for you all.
Now if you will promise to keep this secret, I&#8217;ll
explain just why I&#8217;m anxious to have them see
you boys and girls perform and do your best in
some way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe eagerly agreed to keep the secret, and
Uncle Ben continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been planning about that City Home
ever since we discovered Maggie could sing and
Nelly could design, and some of you boys could
play so well on musical instruments. I see that
it will be necessary to bring all those interested
welfare workers together here to see for themselves
just what good a home in the city will do
to you all. It isn&#8217;t the circus so much, as the
idea to get them here and see the improvement
in Little Citizens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe grinned at the confidence shared with him
and said he would do all he could to make the
show a success.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben then stopped at Mother Maggie&#8217;s
Nest to ask her which of her songs she had decided
to sing at the entertainment. Maggie was
so joyously happy at the opportunity to sing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
public that she rattled off ten songs, one on each
fingertip as she counted&mdash;or she would have forgotten
some.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mister Uncle Ben, if we only had gold
wagons and an elephant! But of course we
can&#8217;t have such wonders!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the boys want a steam calliope to
play the music for the parade,&#8221; ventured Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoh never! You woulden&#8217; let any such awful
thing come an&#8217; whistle itself to pieces around
Happy Hills, would you?&#8221; cried Maggie fearfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; besides, it is impossible to get a calliope
without hiring a lot of performers with it, and
we are going to supply our own talent, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank goodness! If one of them screech-enjuns
came here I&#8217;d run and run till I was out
of hearin&#8217; of it!&#8221; said Maggie, decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you heard that we are to have wild
animals and other wonderful side-shows, eh?&#8221;
asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, an&#8217; I wuz thinkin&#8217;, Mister Uncle Ben:
You&#8217;d have to be mos&#8217; pertickler about handlin&#8217;
them animals! It takes a man what knows wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
beasteses to look after &#8217;em proper. You might
git bitten er killed if you don&#8217;t look out. I saw
some at Central Park Zoo, an&#8217; at the Bronx too,
an&#8217; the keeper had to keep safe away from &#8217;em,
I <i>tell you</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wild animals won&#8217;t hurt anyone. In fact
the &#8216;lion shall lie down with the lamb&#8217; and the
wolf will never think of killing,&#8221; laughed Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a joke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I tell you my secret, will you promise never
to tell anyone?&#8221; whispered Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>Maggie quickly agreed, and thereupon she
heard the most remarkable secret as was yet connected
with the circus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Mister Uncle Ben! How funny! Won&#8217;t
everyone laff!&#8221; said she after a hearty laugh.
But she kept the secret.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben proceeded to the Big House where
the Blue Birds and Bobolinks were awaiting
him. As he drew near, Miss Selina remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s smiling as if he had something funny
to tell us.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he said nothing, and all the coaxing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
urging to tell what had occurred at Happy Hills
to amuse him availed nothing.</p>

<p>While Uncle Ben was training the Blue Birds
and Bobolinks to do their part in the circus all
unknown to Miss Martin, the latter was gradually
absorbing every inhabitant at Happy Hills
camp into her company. Even Dinah and her
assistants offered to do their share. That share
consisted of baking pyramids of good cookies and
ginger-snaps, and preparing lemonade, for a
stand just beside the entrance to the arena.</p>

<p>If the day was bright and clear, the circus
would take place in the clearing where the firemen
exhibited their prowess. If it was rainy, it
would have to be curtailed in many acts but could
be given in part at the Refectory, called &#8220;Hippodrome
Hall&#8221; for the occasion.</p>

<p>The morning dawned bright and cloudless to
the great joy and relief of many worrying circus
people. The benches were quickly placed at the
upper side of the base-ball diamond, and several
large canvases borrowed from a house-painter
in the nearest town, were hung up as screens for
the side-shows.</p>

<p>The Fire-house was decorated with greens and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
flags but the apparatus was pulled out and left
to dazzle all eyes at one side of the building. The
inside was to be used for other purposes.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben had supervised his police and firemen
in erecting temporary pens behind the canvas
screens, and here his wild beasts were to be
exhibited. Adjoining the pens were a number
of large piano cases raised upon posts so that
they were about eighteen inches from the ground.
The front sides of these great boxes were gone
but wooden laths made &#8220;bars to the cages.&#8221; On
the top facing each box was painted the name
of the wild thing within.</p>

<p>The first case was to hold a fierce Numidian
lion, said to be the only one ever caught and
tamed at Happy Hills. Next to this was a red
wolf&mdash;a man-eating wolf at that! Then one was
to see the wild man from Borneo with a great
ring through his nose that he might be made to
obey without danger to his keeper.</p>

<p>Then there was to be an Albino girl, and a few
savage Zulus with poisoned arrows to shoot at
passers-by. There was a placard over one of
the cages saying that the strange animal shown
was the only one of its kind ever found, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
being a native of the Valley of Delight, it was
considered as very valuable.</p>

<p>There were other curiosities to see in the side-shows,
but the greatest interest centered about
the animal cases. The boys who had helped build
the cages told the other Little Citizens, and
naturally it created much guessing and excitement.
Would Mister Uncle Ben really have wild
animals there?</p>

<p>Maggie was in the secret, but so well did she
keep it that no one even guessed she knew the
truth about the plan.</p>

<p>Inside the Fire-house, Uncle Ben and Ned and
Jinks worked hard for several hours before circus
time, then the door was shut and padlocked to
keep out all curious sight-seers.</p>

<p>At two-thirty sharp, the Happy Hills&#8217; Brass
Band struck up a patriotic air and the visitors
and friends who had assembled to witness the
show given by the Little Citizens, hurried to the
circus grounds.</p>

<p>The side-shows had to be visited first, as they
would not be continued after the general performance
began. The Fire-house was the first
in the row so, not only visitors, but Little Citizens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
as well, filed in to see what Uncle Ben had
prepared for them.</p>

<p>The side walls of the small building were covered
with Navajo blankets and other barbarous-colored
draperies. Spears and weapons from
Aunt Selina&#8217;s cozy-corner and oriental collection
were gleaming dangerously from corners.
Freshly cut hay was thrown on the floor to make
a carpet of green, and upon this sat a group of
Hopi Indians. Don and Dot Starr were young
ones while Babs was a papoose strapped in a
wicker basket and stood up in a corner.</p>

<p>A tent was rigged up in one corner and before
this a brave who strongly resembled Meredith,
sat smoking a long peace pipe. But no one could
see any smoke rising from the bowl or from the
lips of the stolid Indian. He was in war-paint
and wore all his trophies of scalps and wild
beasts&#8217; teeth or skulls, so he seemed savage indeed.
Two squaws, one beading a pair of moccasins
and another cooking over a camp-fire, were
too industrious to look up at the curious visitors.</p>

<p>&#8220;The squaw-cook what&#8217;s poking at the kettle
without any fire burning under it, looks a heap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
like Miss Lavinia,&#8221; whispered Maggie, in a stage-tone.</p>

<p>Everyone laughed and even the squaw had to
turn away her face or ruin the effect of the whole
Indian village scene. Dot and Don in streaked
upper-bodies and gaudy skirts from the waist
down, grinned pleasantly at their New York
friends, and posed in a true twin-picture when
Mr. Richards took a snap-shot of the Hopis.</p>

<p>From the Fire-house the crowds went to the
first case: a ferocious lion! Here the visitors
saw an astonishing sight! As the truth dawned
upon them, the New Yorkers laughed heartily
but said nothing that might keep away other
curious visitors.</p>

<p>A great lion-skin from Miss Selina&#8217;s library
had been sewed together so that it appeared as
real as when it was alive on the plains of Africa.
Inside this skin, Ned had carefully placed himself,
and then Uncle Ben had sewn him up in
the seam where the two sides of the skin met.</p>

<p>The poor lion must have been frightfully hot
inside that skin, and he had to pace up and down
the limited cage-room on his hands and feet, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
it would never do to stand up on his hind legs
and try to get a breath of cool air!</p>

<p>As the sight-seers filed past the lion&#8217;s cage,
the fierce animal pawed threateningly at the
weak, wooden laths which was all that kept him
from springing out at the people.</p>

<p>Most of the circus-goers were already past
when a strange howl came from the inside of
that lion-skin:</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigh, Uncle Ben! For pity&#8217;s sake rip me
out of this&mdash;I&#8217;m smothering to pieces!&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the visitors were lingering to study
the Wild Man from Borneo in the next cage and
heard the freak lion that could talk, and everyone
laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>Jinks was the &#8220;Wild Man&#8221; and looked the part,
too. Chains of corn and large lima-beans, with
here and there a red kidney-bean, strung on
strings were profusely hung about his neck.
Wide armlets and anklets of tin were wound
about his limbs and his hair, which was made of
a close-fitted skull-cap with great bunches of
hair taken from a mattress found in the attic of
Aunt Selina&#8217;s house. His face was frightfully
scarred with <i>red crayon</i> cuts where he had fought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
men and beasts and survived; his single garment
was a long strip of sheep&#8217;s skin wound about his
waist. His body was dark red and shiny with
oil, and his hands toyed dangerously with barbed
arrows and a slender bow that now and then
was aimed at his tormentors. Such actions were
accompanied with wild grins that showed fierce
orange-rind teeth fitted into the mouth of the
man-eating human!</p>

<p>The red wolf looked so like Crummie that
many of the Little Citizens were tempted to call
it by name, and strange to say, the animal acted
as if it knew that name! Overhead, however,
the placard plainly stated that the red wolf exhibited
was one of the dangerous kind found in
the Valley of Delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one kin fool me dat dat&#8217;s a wolf! I knows
Crummie if no one else does. Diden&#8217; he save
my life in de boat dat day of de picnic?&#8221; came
from Prunel in no weak voice, and everyone
laughed again at the poor red wolf. Thereupon
the animal wagged its tail.</p>

<p>A strange animal never known to Nature before,
was seen in a small case next to the wolf.
It was green and red and white streaked, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
had a stub tail that was orange colored. The
nose was snubbed and a fear-inspiring gleam of
teeth projecting from an under-shot jaw would
have made one&#8217;s flesh creep had the beast been
free. But everyone heaved sighs of relief to find
Aunt Selina&#8217;s old pet Bull dog safely chained in
a cage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Laws sake! Now how did this dreadful
thing happen to poor old Billy. Ben! Ben! did
you paint Billy like this?&#8221; cried Miss Selina
when she saw her dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;S-sh! don&#8217;t spoil the side-shows!&#8221; warned a
hissing voice behind her, and Flutey turned to
see Mr. Richards&#8217; laughing face close to hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how will we ever get Billy clean again?&#8221;
said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only colored grease paint such as movie
people use&mdash;we&#8217;ll drop him in boiling water and
soon scald off the paint,&#8221; laughed her tormentor.</p>

<p>Meredith Starr was the strongest man on
earth and was seen lifting great balls of iron
and heavy bars of metal. The spheres he picked
up as easily as if they were feathers were marked
5,000 lbs. each, and were as large as a barrel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>&#8220;Mr. Richards, do tell me what he is lifting?&#8221;
queried Aunt Selina.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see they are marked iron?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but they aren&#8217;t really! They look like
hollow paper cubes bronzed over to look like
rusty iron,&#8221; replied Flutey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right at that,&#8221; laughed Mr.
Richards.</p>

<p>The last side-show was a huge cage with a
curtain hanging before its opening. On the curtain
was a notice stating:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the smallest baby-elephant ever exhibited
in a circus, and the visitor is requested
not to feed it peanuts or crackers, as it does not
yet know how to eat alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whenever a large crowd gathered before this
cage, one of the Police would make a great flourish
of drawing back the curtain. Necks would
crane and those visitors standing in the back
could not see the elephant at all. But a loud
shout of merriment would tell all that it was a
good joke, so they waited till the others left when
they could go closer and see the elephant.</p>

<p>It was a little papier-mach&eacute; toy-elephant such
as are sold at Christmas time for the children&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
nursery. There it stood in the center of the
great box and beside it was a great dish of water
and a huge bundle of hay for food.</p>

<p>The fake side-shows being over, the visitors
began to fear their old tease, Mr. Talmage, had
played a joke upon them in bringing them so far
to witness nothing at all. So they walked away
from the cages wondering what would take place
next; then a few of the Police directed them to
the seats at one end of the diamond.</p>

<p>&#8220;What next? Are you going to play a few
more jokes on us?&#8221; demanded one of the visitors
of a Policeman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw&mdash;the reel circus is jus&#8217; goin&#8217; to start!
You see Miss Martin has charge of our show
whiles Mister Uncle Ben agreed to provide side-shows
and wild animals. Now he&#8217;s done with
his&#8217;n.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; said one visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank goodness,&#8221; said another.</p>

<p>But the majority of them laughed at the fun
and said it was all part of the game as Barnum
said: &#8220;An American public loves to be fooled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon after the audience was seated on the
hard wooden benches that reminded them of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
real circus seats at a dollar a seat, Mr. Richards
appeared in the sawdust ring to speak. He was
immediately welcomed with shouts and claps and
such a noise from his city friends that he could
not be heard.</p>

<p>When the tumult died down and he began
to speak, the noise would begin anew, and finally
he shook his head and stood waiting. The men
in the audience finally grew tired of teasing him,
however, and he had his say.</p>

<p>It was to the effect that all the talent about to
be seen and heard had been found and trained
at Happy Hills inside of the past month. All
allowance should be made for the handicaps met
with in a country camp, but the patrons would
find there was plenty of genuine talent in the
different performers about to make their first
appearance in public as entertainers.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>THE SAWDUST RING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The audience felt the usual circus thrill as
they took their places on the narrow board seats;
the tent that always gives a twilight dimness to
the inside of a circus arena was not in evidence,
there being no canvas large enough to borrow
for that purpose, but the ground was thickly
sprinkled with sawdust for the performers&#8217; circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and Gentlemen,&#8221; began Uncle Ben,
as he walked to the center of the ring. &#8220;The
first number on our programme will be the Great
Circus Parade in which all members of the Side
Shows and the regular circus will take part. The
music is furnished by the Little Citizens&#8217; Brass
Band. Kindly refrain from making remarks during
the exhibition.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment Uncle Ben concluded his short
speech, Mr. Richards sprang up and said: &#8220;I
surmise that we may make as many remarks as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
we like <i>before</i> the exhibition, so I wish to know
who elected you Master of Ceremonies?&#8221;</p>

<p>The audience laughed and some clapped their
hands at the question asked Uncle Ben. But he
was equal to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not &#8216;Master of Ceremonies,&#8217; my dear sir, but
simply the &#8216;Ring Master,&#8217;&#8221; replied Uncle Ben,
with a low bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I take objection to being made to sit
here and see a Ring Master without the customary
long waxed mustachios and high silk hat&mdash;to
say nothing of the lack of a swallow-tail coat and
silver-handled whip!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course everyone knew it was all in fun, so
they laughed because Uncle Ben had no retort
ready. After a moment&#8217;s hesitation, however,
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been given authority to maintain order,
and if I hear any further objections from
one who came to see this show on a <i>complimentary</i>
ticket, I will forcibly expel him from the
premises.&#8221;</p>

<p>The threatening tones and the scowl on the
Ring Master&#8217;s face caused a great chorus of
laughter from the audience, and from those performers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
who knew that Uncle Ben and his dear
friend Mr. Richards were trying to get the best
of each other in the fun-argument.</p>

<p>But the blare of horns coming from back of
the canvas curtain interrupted any further attacks,
so the Ring Master retired to attend to the
order of march.</p>

<p>A drum-major led the band. He was dressed
in a high bearskin hat with gold tassels draped
in front of it. His blue uniform was also elaborately
trimmed with tinsel and gold ornaments
that reminded everyone of Christmas Tree trimmings.
In fact that is just what they were!</p>

<p>The Brass Band followed and blew its instruments
so lustily that no attention was paid to
time or notes. Noise, and plenty of it, was what
every member was eager to accomplish.</p>

<p>After the band, the freaks and wild animals
followed, but the Numidian lion had thrown
back its head-piece and the boy&#8217;s hot face peeping
out looked very strange as it surmounted the
shaggy lion rug.</p>

<p>After the side-show members came the regular
circus performers&mdash;bareback riders, acrobats,
pugilists, etcetera.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>Every Little Citizen in camp wished to be in
the Grand Parade and everyone had some odd bit
of decoration to distinguish his or her connection
with so illustrious a company.</p>

<p>Some of the little girls had gathered great
quantities of daisies and buttercups and other
wild flowers, and had sewed them all over their
camp dresses. Many of the little boys, too small
to take part in the acting, were costumed in
foliage-covered clothes or in fancy paper suits.</p>

<p>The parade over, the troupe sought refuge
back of the canvas curtain to await the call of
each performer. The selected &#8220;pieces&#8221; of the
Brass Band now took their seats in front of the
canvas and showed the audience what a volume
of sound six members of the band could send
forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our first number will be a clog dance. This
is the public d&eacute;but of our famous Little Citizen
Dancer, so I wish all present to take particular
notice of his accomplishment,&#8221; announced the
Ring Master, who now appeared with the drum-major&#8217;s
bearskin upon his head, and the drum-major&#8217;s
tinsel-decorated baton for a stick.</p>

<p>Uproarious applause followed the announcement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
but it was never known whether the clapping
was for the hat and stick or for the d&eacute;but
of the clog-dancer.</p>

<p>The visitors were sincerely interested in the
dancing and felt gratified that one of the Little
Citizens should have been found with such ability&mdash;it
became apparent that something might
be made of the boy.</p>

<p>Following the clog-dancer, came Maggie to
sing her songs. Miss Martin had had the piano
moved from the Refectory to the ring, and now
played the accompaniment while the little girl
sang her favorite songs taught her by the Settlement
Worker of the East Side.</p>

<p>As the pure tones of the &#8220;Prince of Peace,&#8221;
then the inspired words and air of &#8220;Our America&#8221;
were heard, the audience showed more than
ordinary interest. The little singer was encored
again and again and she smiled happily as she
stepped to the Ring again and sang her other
favorites. The visitors whispered together at the
wonderful genius discovered in their midst, and
again Maggie was encored to sing yet one more
song. This last one was &#8220;Love&#8217;s Lullaby,&#8221; and
was Maggie&#8217;s solace in times of trouble.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>The applause given Maggie was a great encouragement
to the other performers, so the orator
of the camp, the elocutionist, and many other
talented Little Citizens, found their efforts welcomed
by the audience.</p>

<p>When the &#8220;Stars&#8221; had concluded their parts,
Uncle Ben announced that the thrillers would
take place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Goldie Silverheels will now show her
superb bareback riding,&#8221; said he, with a bow.</p>

<p>Immediately after this introduction, Miss
Goldie rode in on Farmer Jones&#8217; young horse.
The steed was gorgeous in his colored trappings,
and Miss Goldie was in the seventh heaven of
delight, for she had on a tarletan dress all beflounced,
and a wreath of flowers in her hair.</p>

<p>The horse, Bob, moved sedately about the sawdust
ring, and it took some urging from his rider
to coax him into a gallop.</p>

<p>The bareback rider was fearless and daring
in her tricks and showed an unusual understanding
of horses and the way to control them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what that girl can become? A
wonderful instructor in a Riding Academy,&#8221; remarked
one lady to another, as Miss Goldie rode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
out of the ring with applause sounding acceptably
in her ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I should hate to have her become a
circus actor, don&#8217;t you know,&#8221; replied the lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just why she should be taken in hand
at once, to train her for something worthy before
a third-rate circus troupe discovers her courage
and ability.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make a note of it and refer the matter to Mr.
Talmage,&#8221; advised the lady, and it was written
down on a small pad.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a most remarkable treat in store,
now, for our New York friends. You have never
seen anything better at a dog show, nor at a
Circus or Hippodrome,&#8221; called Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Crummie, the dog-hero that saved
one of our Little Citizens from drowning a short
time ago,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>At mention of his name, Crummie ran out into
the Ring. But what a different-looking Crummie
from the dirty, matted-wool dog that won
the medal for bravery the day of the picnic!</p>

<p>Uncle Ben had superintended the task of clipping
him, so that he presented a distinctly aristocratic
appearance. His main body had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
shaven, leaving tawny patches of wool on ankles,
neck and head. The tail, too, had a thick bunch
of wool on its end and a ring of wool about the
base. The long hair on his forehead was tied in
a knot with a fancy ribbon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crummie, salute the ladies!&#8221; said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>The dog faced the audience and bowed politely
to them. A general laugh rewarded him. Then
Uncle Ben said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Crummie, call for your master to take
charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dog turned and looked at the Band and
barked again and again, but no result followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crummie, go over and escort your master to
the Ring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the dog ran directly to Bill and pulled at
his feet. Bill laughingly arose, and the dog immediately
took hold of his hand with his teeth
and led him out. This brought a loud clapping
from the visitors.</p>

<p>Then Bill put Crummie through his letter-writing
trick, through his prayers, his dancing on
hind legs, his lately acquired trick of playing
fireman (taught him by the Fire Brigade) and
the other things he could do. The audience thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
appreciated it all and thought the performance
was over when they saw Crummie run
back of the curtain.</p>

<p>But he soon returned rolling a small drum
before him. He left it just before his master and
ran away again. This time he returned with the
two drum sticks in his mouth. He held them
until Bill took them from him, and Uncle Ben
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Crummie has just joined the Brass Band and
has only been taking lessons in playing the drum
for a week. If he does not keep good time, or
hold the sticks according to the book, you must
overlook the fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill placed a drum-stick in the dog&#8217;s mouth and
Crummie sat upon his haunches before the drum
and began to rat-tat rat-tat-tat! rat-tat, rat-tat-tat!
r-r-r-at-tat-tat! r-r-r-tat-tat! Er-r-r-r-r-rat!
er-r-r-r-r-tat! er-r-r-r-r-rat-tattat-tattoo.</p>

<p>This syncopated playing he kept up until Bill
laughingly clapped his hands, then Crummie
dropped the stick and pranced about his master,
showing how thoroughly he enjoyed music. The
clapping was prolonged until the audience found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Crummie had still another form of music to render
for them.</p>

<p>This time, Bill attached the cymbal to Crummie&#8217;s
tail and tied a small hammer to one paw.
The other paw had a string tied to it, and this
string pulled a lever that sounded a whistle. Then
the dog was given the drum-stick again, and the
signal for music was sounded by his master.</p>

<p>This time, Crummie thumped the cymbals with
his tail, while striking the glass-cylinders with
the hammer fastened on his left paw. The string
was jerked irregularly to sound the whistle, but
the drum fared badly, as the dog was so intent
on the other three instruments that he forgot to
beat with the stick held between his teeth, except
at rare intervals. But the sagacity shown by the
animal won tremendous applause from the audience,
so that both master and dog felt amply
repaid for the tedious hours of practice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we have a scene between two Roman
Gladiators in the open arena. This will end our
performance, but the guests are all invited to the
Refectory, where the Little Citizens wish to serve
refreshments to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>After some arguing back of the canvas curtain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
the visitors were amused to see a Roman chariot
appear. Bob and Dobbin were hitched tandem to
a two-wheeled dump-cart. But the cart had been
white-washed&mdash;wheels and body, and festooned
with wild flowers until it presented a gala appearance.
The two horses balked at pulling the
familiar cart <i>&agrave; la tandem</i> and Bob wished to precede
Dobbin, and the latter wished to stop to investigate
a sweet-smelling bunch of clover right
in his pathway to glory.</p>

<p>Therefore, the two Gladiators who stood in the
cart endeavoring to coax their steeds to more
speed, felt abashed at the laughter accorded their
entrance into the arena.</p>

<p>But once the imperfectly-matched horses had
drawn the cart to its goal, the two athletic-looking
boys jumped lightly out and posed in attitudes
approved in boxing rings.</p>

<p>This last number was wildly applauded by the
men present, but the ladies said they could see
nothing entertaining in boxing! The bout being
ended, the two contestants shook hands and
looked about for the chariot which was to carry
them back to the dressing room. The attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
of all present was thus attracted to the cart and
horses, and a general laugh echoed over the field.</p>

<p>Dobbin being unaccustomed to the wreaths of
wild clover blossoms and daisies hung about his
neck and farm-harness, had managed to pull part
of his decoration around to one side and stood
calmly chewing it up. Bob on the other hand, had
so resented being hitched to an old-fashioned nag
as Dobbin was that he had twisted and backed
and pulled until the not-too-secure tandem-harness
hastily contrived of rope and bits of strap,
broke and left him to gambol away to the fresh
green grass growing on the banks of the brook.</p>

<p>So the exit of the Romans was made on their
own pedals and Farmer Jones was sent to capture
his two steeds and cart.</p>

<small>THE CITY HOME PLAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>At the Refectory the guests were treated to
cakes and lemonade and were waited upon by the
Little Citizens who had been taught to wait on
each other properly, or when visitors were present
to attend to their needs first.</p>

<p>Everyone was talking about the success of the
circus, and but few remembered the Side Shows
that had given Uncle Ben so much trouble to
arrange. It was the unusual talents shown by
the young performers that caused most of the
comments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you can see why I had you come to
Happy Hills,&#8221; said Uncle Ben, as he heard the
city friends exchanging their views.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but what further good can we do than
hope for the future of each of these children?&#8221;
asked one of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you have heard and seen for yourselves,
instead of being told by others of the budding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
genuises to be found in our Little Citizens,
I have a plan to propose. It is something that
will need immediate decision if Richards is to go
ahead with the scheme and have things ready
for September occupancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the plan I wish to lay before you all
today:</p>

<p>&#8220;We expect a number of new arrivals at camp
next week, and no one knows what talent may
be hidden in the heart of each one of those Little
Citizens. We have already found valuable
material to work upon here, and it must be educated
and taken care of&mdash;we must not permit it
to die for lack of nourishment&mdash;mental and moral,
you know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have discussed this plan with Miss Selina,
Miss Martin, and Mr. Richards, and they agree
with me that it is not only feasible, but necessary,
if we are to keep up the ambition and education
of these talented children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Richards has agreed to hunt up a large
house in New York at a moderate rental&mdash;one
that we can remodel to suit ourselves, thereby
being able to have a long lease at a reduced rent.
We have even thought of the name of such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
home. How do you like &#8216;Blue Bird Home for
Little Wonders&#8217; or just the &#8216;Blue Bird and Bobolink
Home,&#8217; or perhaps some of you would prefer
the name of &#8216;Little Citizens&#8217; Home&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Talmage, I think the name is the last
consideration to worry over. Let us first decide
whether there is to be a home,&#8221; called out
one of the gentlemen visitors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there will be a home, all right, even if a
few of us have to support it,&#8221; declared Mr. Richards,
positively.</p>

<p>&#8220;After hearing and seeing our gifted Little
Citizens we all think the same as Mr. Richards&mdash;there
must be some form of home provided until
the children are self-supporting,&#8221; added a lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing to decide upon is, how many of
you will join in this endeavor and enlist others
to help support the home. Miss Selina has promised
to close up this country place for the winter
and take up her residence at the Home. Miss
Martin, who is a most valuable and experienced
Settlement Worker and Nature teacher, has also
agreed to help Flutey look after the house and
children. I, too, will agree to take up a permanent
residence at the place to be on hand during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
evenings and holidays to advise and help in any
way I can. There will be other friends who will
eagerly offer their time and help also, I am sure.
The sum of money we may have to use for this
venture will determine the size of the house we
can secure and pay for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will need a regular asylum to house all
these Little Citizens, and those extra ones you
still expect from the city,&#8221; remarked a pessimistic
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t at all likely that everyone here
this summer will take up a residence in the city
home. In fact, the invitation is only open to
those who can prove themselves efficient in some
manner of work or study. Not that we shall discriminate
between trades or professions&mdash;we
shall not&mdash;but in order to be an inmate of our
home a Little Citizen must prove that he is steady,
ambitious, moral, and obedient to rules, before he
can become a member in our family.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will not consider the application of anyone
who is resentful or malicious in thought, or disobedient
in purpose as well as in deed. Anyone
who will willingly mislead a companion to disregard
rules and regulations cannot be accepted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
as one child can upset a whole colony in a little
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Talmage, you seem to have decided
upon having such a home and it only remains for
us to join the number who have already agreed
to experiment with the idea for the future welfare
of our little &#8216;Jenny Lind,&#8217; the budding
&#8216;Thomas Edison,&#8217; the great band leader
&#8216;Sousa,&#8217; and a few other famous people or their
young namesakes,&#8221; said one of the Committee
chosen for the Easter Outing that spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about it,&#8221; acknowledged Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then count on me&mdash;or count on my check
which is more to the point,&#8221; laughed the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;There now&mdash;Richards, hand Sam the agreement
to sign at once before he changes his mind.
Sam you can mention the size of the check you
will donate after you sign your name. You will
find several names already signed,&#8221; said Uncle
Ben, passing the long legal paper to Mr. Richards
to hand over to the man.</p>

<p>The first visitor to join the new organization
read the paper handed him and then stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I will read aloud the names of the
members who have already joined and donated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
this Winter Home&mdash;it may inspire others to &#8216;go
and do likewise.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see, my friends, we already have a
goodly sum to add our mites to. Mr. Talmage,
I will agree to start with a thousand dollars,
and pay a monthly sum of a hundred dollars. If
you find yourselves in need of financial support
let me know and I will pull you out to a certain
extent.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>The Blue Birds and Bobolinks had been most
interested listeners to the discussion which would
mean a successful launching of the city home for
their Little Citizens, and when the last speaker
concluded and had agreed to donate so liberally,
Ned sprang up and shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Three cheers for the Home for Little Wonders!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the rousing cheer that replied to his call
showed everyone that the interest was genuine
and not for display purposes as is the case in so
many charitable gifts that are made.</p>

<p>The agreement to donate passed through every
hand of the visitors present and when it was returned
to Uncle Ben, it was filled with names.
The grand total was more than enough to assure
success to the venture for the first year at any
rate.</p>

<p>As the result of the visit and circus entertainment
was made known to all, the Little Citizens
looked dumb with surprise. Such a lot of
money as these people agreed to spend just to give
them a good winter home!</p>

<p>Then Bill jumped upon his feet&mdash;he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
kneeling in a corner of the Refectory listening
with all his might.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you kids, wassa matter wid cheerin&#8217;
Uncle Ben and all his fren&#8217;s&mdash;not a sickly cheer
but a good healthy one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nuttin&#8217;s de matter wid dat! Hey all! Git
ready now! One-two-t&#8217;ree!&#8221; yelled Joe, and he
swung his old cap as he counted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hip! Hip! Hurrah! fer everybuddy here!&#8221;
shouted every lusty youngster present, and the
din spoke well for their health.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigh&mdash;once more&mdash;whad&#8217;s de matter wid
Uncle Ben?&#8221; called Bill, excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right! Hip! Hip! Hurrah fer all!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Bill seemed to remember an important
matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister Uncle Ben, please kin I say somethin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly Bill&mdash;speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kin we do to help a poor dog what is a
genius?&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone laughed at the question, but Bill
took no offence as he was too concerned about
finding a home for Crummie, where the canine
intelligence might be expanded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;Why, it stands to reason that if you prove
yourself efficient enough to join our home this
winter, Crummie will be most valuable in helping
Miss Selina to keep away tramps and those who
have no business about our house. At odd times
the dog can practice his own profession and report
to you at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill grinned joyfully and Crummie, who had
been crouching beside him, thumped his tail upon
the floor in satisfaction.</p>

<p>The time was at hand when all the automobiles
were summoned to carry the visitors back to New
York, and soon after the last whirr of wheels
was heard going down the driveway, the Little
Citizens scattered to their evening tasks. Some
to see that the precious Fire-engine was safely
housed again, some to Police the community
where laxity had prevailed all day and Little Citizens
had broken the strict laws laid down by the
Chief of Police; but the majority of the children
were too tired and sleepy to think of anything
but a cup of milk and a piece of bread and butter,
before tumbling into their Nests for the
night.</p>

<p>At Flutey&#8217;s house, the Blue Birds and Bobolinks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
were too excited to think of supper or bed.
The sum total of the donations signed up that
afternoon amounted in their opinions to such an
enormous lot of money that they thought it possible
to buy outright a big ready-made Home
somewhere in the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;You country children do not understand the
value of city real estate. Why all of Mossy Glen
and Oak Crest together would not sell for enough
cash to pay for one dirty old tenement on the
East Side. So you can understand that the sum
which has been promised us will not seem so much
after a few months&#8217; rent is paid in advance. Besides
we must have good plumbing and ventilation,
and repairs cost money, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t choose an old house&mdash;get a brand-new
one,&#8221; suggested Dot Starr.</p>

<p>&#8220;But a new one will cost a great deal more to
start with, and every month besides. We can
lease an old one and renovate it to suit ourselves,
with lots of little rooms for chambers and great
big assembly rooms on the first floor, and the
rent will be but half as much as if the owner
makes repairs,&#8221; explained Mr. Richards.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why the Starr family has to stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
in Oakdale all winter. Other folks go to live in
the city when it&#8217;s cold&mdash;why can&#8217;t we?&#8221; grumbled
Don, who would have preferred living with the
Little Citizens wherever they were to be located.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the Talmages and Starrs moved to New
York this winter where could I take the Little
Citizens every Saturday for the weekly outing?&#8221;
asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>Don had not thought of this, and he brightened
up instantly. Then Dot thought of something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, if we all went to live in the city how
would the magazine ever get published? And
without a magazine you would have no way to
pay that donation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me, that everything is arranged
wisely and well, so there is no need for Blue Birds
or Bobolinks to wish they were in other birds&#8217;
nests,&#8221; added Flutey.</p>

<small>MISS MARTIN&#8217;S LITTLE STORIES OF GREAT
PEOPLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The Blue Birds and Bobolinks had only a few
days more to stay at Happy Hills, and they all
wanted to make the most of them. They were at
camp from early morning till late at night, and
in that time they became better acquainted with
the lives and hopes of their Little Citizens than
years of casual visits would have accomplished.</p>

<p>Miss Martin had formed a daily story-telling
class for anyone who wished to sit and listen.
But she was most determined about interruptions.
If you wanted to hear the story you were
welcome, but you must not scuffle across the Refectory
floor when the tale was half finished, and
once you came quietly in to listen, you must remain
till the end!</p>

<p>So it became a custom for many of the Little
Citizens to so manage their play and work that
they might have the noon hour to spare for the
story-telling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>The day after the circus, Miss Martin pleased
her hearers by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;The theme of the story today, friends, is
about some famous people. But they will be
such short stories that it will be necessary for
each one to look up the longer story and history
of my heroes and heroines in the large book here
on this table. I will leave it for Jinks or Ned to
read from if anyone wishes to hear the full account
of the famous ones I shall mention.</p>

<p>&#8220;My first story will be of a poor little peasant
boy who became a great poet.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a cold night in winter, and in the old-time
kitchen of an English abbey, a number of
servants were seated about a blazing fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now an abbey is a place built to shelter and
protect the people who need sanctuary in times
of strife or war. And in olden times the people
needed such refuges as there was constant warring
and fighting with lawless men.</p>

<p>&#8220;So this abbey, half-house and half-church, had
a number of servants to keep it in order. These
men now sat resting after the day&#8217;s work was
done, talking or singing songs as the wind whistled
out-of-doors.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Whose turn is it now?&#8217; asked the head-servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so they took turns in singing their favorite
songs until the cow-herd saw it would soon
be his turn to sing. He thought he could not sing
a note and he dreaded being jeered at by his companions,
so he crept quietly away and hid in with
the cows in the straw in the stable. Here he remained
waiting for the men to retire and forget
about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, suddenly, he seemed to fall into a deep
sleep, and a glorious figure appeared before him.
The humble fellow thought it was an angel, and
when she spoke in stern yet loving tones, he
trembled and wanted to run away.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sing,&#8217; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cow-herd gazed pitifully up at her, but
could not open his mouth to utter a sound. He
was as mute as when he feared his companions
in the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sing of God and his Creation!&#8217; continued
the angel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the frightened lad tried to make a sound
and to his astonishment he sang several pure
notes, so he continued. As he sang of the Spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
Creation which was made so perfect and eternal
by the Father of All, the kine turned their
heads and listened. When the farmer-boy had
overcome his shyness in singing such wonderful
truths, the angel disappeared but the singer knew
it not. He was now so uplifted by his singing
that he even failed to hear the men who came
running from the kitchen to see who the great
singer could be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancy their amazement when they found their
humble cow-herder singing in the stable. Then
they waited, breathless, till he had concluded, and
led him back to the house. There he was made
to sing for the mistress and other women who
took charge of the abbey.</p>

<p>&#8220;They, too, listened in hushed surprise and as
the inspiring lines poured forth, they bowed their
heads in reverence, for they knew that the Lord
had given the lowly shepherd the gift with which
to voice His praise.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so this cow-herd, whose name was C&aelig;dmon,
became a great singer and poet of England.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Martin concluded the first story and
Maggie was greatly pleased, as she took the story
to herself, but some of the boys who were beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
to show a gift in singing, also felt that
the story was told for their benefit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m going to tell you how a very humble
man became rich and famous. He was poorer
than any of you Little Citizens could ever be, for
he was a slave. He was the property of another
man and even though he worked very hard, he
could never have anything of his own while he
was a slave.</p>

<p>&#8220;But one day, his master found he would have
to sell his slaves, so he had them all go to a
slave-market in a distant city.</p>

<p>&#8220;Each slave had to carry a load of goods, as
the master expected to sell many of his valuable
possessions at the same time that he accompanied
the slaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;In those days there were no carriages or
beasts to ride and carry baggage, for the slaves
were expected to do this labor. Great bundles
were made up so that each slave might have a
goodly-sized load. These were waiting for them
to shoulder when the procession came from the
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;The young slave who was a deep thinker, had
pondered over the various pieces of baggage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
and thus had discovered which one held the food
for the three days&#8217; journey for the entire party.</p>

<p>&#8220;This great package, &AElig;sop chose for his burden.
The other slaves laughed at his foolish selection
for their own burdens were smaller and
lighter. But the young slave said nothing. He
started away with his load, and the others followed
him, jeering. The master rode last and
also wondered why the best young slave he had
should choose so cumbersome a load.</p>

<p>&#8220;They had started out at daybreak and after
travelling several hours, stopped by a well for the
morning meal. &AElig;sop opened his baggage and
spread out the rations for breakfast. All ate, and
the slave again shouldered his load, but it was a
bit lighter.</p>

<p>&#8220;At noon they stopped and ate again, and the
load was then much smaller and still lighter.
That night, the entire party ate supper, and the
burden grew still lighter and much smaller.</p>

<p>&#8220;The three meals the following day more than
lessened half the burden &AElig;sop carried, and before
the travellers reached the city, hot, weary,
and exhausted from carrying such loads so far,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
&AElig;sop had nothing to carry as the food was eaten
and the load was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;The master was so impressed at this wisdom
shown by the slave that he told the story to the
men in the city. They said that &AElig;sop was a wise
man and must bring a goodly sum to his owner.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very rich man heard the story when he
came to the slave-market to select a servant, and
he determined to secure &AElig;sop, so he bid high
and purchased him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Xanthus, the new master, took &AElig;sop to Samos,
his home, and there the slave became known
everywhere for his wisdom and judgment. He
always had a fable to apply to any need or cause,
so that he was sought by rich and poor alike for
advice and help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally, Xanthus gave &AElig;sop his freedom and
the man who once had been a slave with no rights
to own anything&mdash;not even himself&mdash;became famous
and was sought by kings and statesmen for
his wisdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>As this story was ended, one of the boys shouted,
&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to be&mdash;a wise judge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be a wise judge, you must first learn to
think and do only right and just things yourself;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
then you can find the wisdom to judge others,&#8221;
replied Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do, Miss Marting,&#8221;
promised the eager lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now another short story that I will tell you,
is about always speaking the truth. Truth is a
great power in the world, and we may sometimes
think we have been wrong to adhere strictly to the
truth, but in the end we find we have gained in
everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great Persian king named Cyrus sent his
son to a far city to study in a famous school that
he might be ready to reign over Persia at the
King&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Otanes had always been taught the great value
of truth, and as he stood ready to depart from his
home with the company of men who were to see
that he arrived safely, his parents again reminded
him to always adhere to truth and he would
lose <i>nothing</i>!</p>

<p>&#8220;The caravan had travelled all day and halted
at sun-down for rest when a band of outlaws rode
from ambush and demanded all that the travellers
possessed. There was no use in resisting so
large a company of thieves, so the merchants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
gave up their property. One of the rascals spied
Otanes who was silently watching the proceedings,
so he called to the boy:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Have you anything to give me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have gold,&#8217; replied the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gold! How much and where do you carry
it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;In my hat, and it is enough to pay my way.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ha, ha, ha! That&#8217;s a good joke,&#8217; laughed the
man as he passed by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the Chief of the band rode up to the boy,
and said: &#8216;Well, I don&#8217;t suppose you carry anything
of value&mdash;you are too young to be trusted
with gold.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Otanes said nothing to this as it required no
answer, but when the Chief looked at the silent
boy, and said again:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But have you anything of value about your
person? What do you happen to have?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have gold for my journey and education.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gold! Why, you&#8217;re a mere boy! Where do
you hide it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;In my hat.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let me see,&#8217; ordered the robber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Otanes removed his hat and displayed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
gold. The Chief stood in surprise for a moment,
and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why did you tell us you had it&mdash;we would
never have dreamed that you had gold hidden on
your person?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Did you not ask me?&#8217; wondered Otanes.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, but you could have denied it, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That would have been an untruth, and I am
not a coward that I must lie to any man!&#8217; replied
Otanes, proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chief was so impressed with the lad&#8217;s
words that he gave back his gold and said: &#8216;May
you always live up to that ideal.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Otanes did, for he became one of the
great and famous men of his day.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence as Miss Martin concluded
this tale, then one of the boys said: &#8220;Maybe
Otanes wouldn&#8217;t have been so honest about giving
up dat money if it was all he had; but he
knew he could git more from his fadder when he
got to de city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite sure Otanes would have acted exactly
the same whether he were a newsboy in
New York or the king&#8217;s son in Persia. Besides,
he could <i>not</i> send back home for more money from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
his father, as it took a long time to cross the
desert and it might be months, or a year, before
another caravan would reach his father and be
able to bring back money for the boy. So that
was not the reason of his telling the truth, you
see,&#8221; replied Miss Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Marting, won&#8217;t you please tell us somethin&#8217;
about children what made pickshers an&#8217; grew
into fine painters!&#8221; asked one of the children, and
little Nelly Finn smiled with anticipation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you about the great Raphael in my
last talk and also about the slave who watched
his master and thus educated himself to become
even greater than his teacher. Now I will tell
you about a simple shepherd lad who used to
make pictures on the rocks and pieces of bark,
with a burnt stick for crayon.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was working with such interest one day
that he failed to see a man approach him. The
stranger watched the work for a time and was so
amazed at the talent shown that he touched the
boy on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lad sprang up and courtesied, then the
man said: &#8216;Who taught you to draw like that?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Myself, master.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Who are you, and whose sheep are those?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My name is Giotto and I am the shepherd-boy
to a rich man who lives near here,&#8217; replied
the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Would you like to know how to paint pictures
of other things as well as of trees and sheep?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Giotto&#8217;s joy was answer enough, so the man
called upon the owner of the sheep and told him
what a great painter he thought the lad would
make. Then he also went to the humble home of
the shepherd-boy and asked the father to let him
take his son to be educated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stranger turned out to be Cimabue, the
greatest painter of his day, and Giotto accompanied
him to Florence where he was taught to
paint wonderful pictures. In fact, Giotto became
even a greater painter than his master, and
the simple shepherd-lad was the friend of many
great men at that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nelly expressed her satisfaction at the story,
and the other Little Citizens who liked to draw,
also clapped their hands. Then Miss Martin
stood up and the children sighed for they did not
want her to end her stories so soon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, tell us somethin&#8217; &#8217;bout our own American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
people, Miss Marting!&#8221; begged one of the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, Miss Martin! Tell us about Thomas
Edison, and Mister Colonel Roosevelt, and McKinley,
and other famous men of now!&#8221; added
many voices.</p>

<p>Miss Martin laughed, as she replied: &#8220;Why
you children know as much about our present-day
heroes and great men as I do, but perhaps you
do not know about Robert Fulton, or the poets
and painters of recent years in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no&mdash;tell us!&#8221; quickly demanded a chorus
of voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Robert Fulton was a little country boy
who loved to fish and swim and paddle about the
creeks just like any other little boy does in summer-time.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day he and his chum were fishing but the
boat was heavy and lumbering, and had to be
pushed about by means of a long pole. It was
slow work and as Bob was trying to reach a spot
in the stream where the fish might bite better,
he grumbled at the arduous task of moving the
tub.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why don&#8217;t we use a row-boat the next time?&#8217;
asked his friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Even rowing is hard work, and there ought
to be an easy way for boys to push their boats
about,&#8217; said Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the next day Bob called his friend and together
they went to the wood-shed to make something
Robert had thought out the night before as
he lay in bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What is it, anyway?&#8217; asked his chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;ll see&mdash;it&#8217;s something to move our boat
about without much work.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;After a great deal of sawing and hammering,
the two boys came from the wood-shed with two
cumbersome looking things that looked like small
fans on an old wind-mill.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;ve got, Bob?&#8217; called a boy
in passing the lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, we&#8217;ve got a scheme to make a boat go
without working!&#8217; replied Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;The older boy laughed and passed on his way,
but the two friends hurried to their scow with
the heavy paddle-wheels and managed to fasten
them, one on each side of the boat. An old rod
reached across the boat from one wheel to the
other, and when all was ready, the boys jumped in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob Fulton sat on the seat and took hold of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
the iron bar. This he turned like one would turn
the crank on a well-handle. In revolving, this
bar turned the paddles around in the water and
the propelling moved the boat through the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boys were so delighted at the success of
the plan that they did nothing else all day but
ride up and down the stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;That night the boys told of their invention
and fun, and Bob was praised for his work. Then
he thought of the value such an idea might have
for others, and he worked and planned until he
finally evolved the side-wheel boats. Later, he
invented the way to propel boats by steam instead
of horse-power in turning the wheels.</p>

<p>&#8220;From this small beginning, we have today the
great ocean steamers and other craft that sail
our seas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s a fine story, Miss Martin. Tell us anudder
like it,&#8221; said the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Little Citizens are always hungry for
more,&#8221; laughed the story-teller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yeh see, Miss Marting, a feller can&#8217;t
never get enough of truth, kin he?&#8221; remarked a
young wonder.</p>

<p>Miss Martin was so struck by the logic of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
reply that she sat down and looked at the little
speaker in amazement. Then she said: &#8220;For
that remarkable sentence, Jimmy, I will tell you a
true story of King Solomon, the wisest judge and
man of words that ever lived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you have heard me speak of the
Queen of Sheba and how she tried to catch Solomon
in many ways but failed!</p>

<p>&#8220;One day she brought in two garlands of flowers
exactly alike. One could not tell one from the
other, so alike were they.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, King, I have here two garlands of flowers
for you to see and tell me which is the real and
which the false,&#8217; said the Queen, after the ceremony
of presentation was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;As Solomon gazed at the lovely flowers he
was at a loss to say which was Nature&#8217;s result
and which the one made by the cunning of man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he looked from the window to think how
he might detect the false wreath. As he did so,
he saw some bees buzzing in and out of the blossoms
hanging from a vine over the window casement.
This gave him the idea he needed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ordered a slave to open wide the window,
and it was done. Soon after, a bee flew in and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
circled about for a moment, but scenting the sweet
flowers, made straight for the wreath in the
Queen&#8217;s left hand. Another bee followed almost
immediately after and settled upon the honey-laden
blossoms. Other bees flew in and began sipping
the nectar from the cups of the flowers and
Solomon said: &#8216;You have your answer, O
Queen!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<small>THE END OF A HAPPY SUMMER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Say Micky, dis is some trip from Noo York to
Happy Hills, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; remarked Skelly, as he
fidgeted in the seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cuz yeh are so anxious to git there. Now
I&#8217;m a lookin&#8217; out the winder at all the trees and
little houses we pass an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t so tired wid de
ride,&#8221; replied Micky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mick, do yeh really t&#8217;ink dey kin make a real
artist of Nelly? Why, she&#8217;s on&#8217;y a kid,&#8221; said
Skelly to whom it seemed impossible that quiet
and meekness should have any power hidden
under its cloak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s what Mister Uncle Ben tol&#8217; me last week
in his office, yeh know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why ain&#8217;t you or me got some such talent in
our heads?&#8221; persisted Skelly, complainingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we have, but we are so chuck full of
work and fight that the quiet t&#8217;ings ain&#8217;t got time
to sift out, yeh see. Ef we was to settle down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
quiet-like for a week at Happy Hills mebbe somethin&#8217;
would show up fer us, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, t&#8217;ank goodness we got a ticket to take a
vacation anyway! I hope to goodness, dey don&#8217;t
make you sing church hymns and pray every
udder minute of de day!&#8221; muttered Skelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;tche go an&#8217; spoil everyt&#8217;ing at camp wid
your kickin&#8217;, Skelly! Ef you don&#8217;t like de way
t&#8217;ings are run yeh kin always go back to de city,
yeh know. It ain&#8217;t costin&#8217; yuh nuttin&#8217;,&#8221; advised
Micky, with anxious concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll try and stick it out fer a week, as long
as you t&#8217;ink you&#8217;ll stay too.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the station was called out where the two
boys had to leave the train, they looked eagerly
about at the lovely scene. Green grass, green
trees, green bushes everywhere and no sign up:
&#8220;Keep Off, Private Grounds&#8221;&mdash;or familiar
boards such as they knew of in the city parks
which read: &#8220;Keep off the Grass&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t pick
flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, Micky! Even de sky looks green wid de
udder green t&#8217;ings a-shinin&#8217;,&#8221; breathed Skelly,
softly.</p>

<p>A lark suddenly began his lay and the two boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
looked at each other, then about them for the
songster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dis is somethin&#8217; like, eh, Skelly?&#8221; chuckled
Micky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bet&#8217;cher life, pard! Come on, le&#8217;s hurry to
camp an&#8217; see what it&#8217;s like. Ef it&#8217;s anything like
dis, I kin stand a week of it,&#8221; replied delighted
Skelly.</p>

<p>Before either boy could see which country road
to take, a touring car sped up and Uncle Ben
hailed the travellers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there you are, my boys! I was delayed
down the road by a blow-out or I would have been
here when the train pulled in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys grinned and looked at each other.
Were <i>they</i> going to ride in that swell car?</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump in now, and we&#8217;ll soon be whisked back
to Happy Hills where your friends are waiting to
greet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the two over-worked little newsboys scrambled
in and dropped upon the soft leather cushions
with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hully gee! Dis is de life, all right, Mister
Uncle Ben,&#8221; gurgled Micky.</p>

<p>&#8220;While we are passing this lovely country-side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
you can look about and see what an ideal place
it is for boys and girls. See the big lake for the
older boys where they can fish and swim? Over
there is a stretch of forest land where we often go
to hunt up wild flowers and other interesting
things in Nature. And just a few miles on the
other side of the station there is quite a town
where we can buy anything we might need during
the summer. Now when we reach Happy Hills
you will see how complete everything is there for
an outdoor life for Little Citizens.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys paid attention to the remarks and
agreed with Uncle Ben that the location was ideal
for everyone. Then the car neared the woods
from whence rose a noisy babel of sound&mdash;happy
laughter and singing, or calling, of many children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are, boys&mdash;and there comes Nelly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Micky could not believe his eyes. Was that
rosy, plump little girl who was running to meet
him, his sickly, crippled little sister? Even the
precocious, hardened little Skelly was impressed
by the great improvement in the little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Micky, I&#8217;m so glad you are here! And
Micky I kin make pickshers of ladies&#8217; dresses all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
de time now, and make money for you and me,
some day!&#8221; cried Nelly, flinging her arms about
her brother&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>From that moment, Skelly was a subdued
young man, for he was too interested to remember
his threats about going back to the city, and
he saw so many familiar faces of children&mdash;yet
not familiar as they had been once, for these faces
were round and rosy, and the children happy and
always busy about something which is the secret
of true happiness and contentment.</p>

<p>Little Mother Maggie was introduced to
Nelly&#8217;s two visitors, and after a time, the little
hostess asked Maggie to sing and show the boys
how she was improving.</p>

<p>Without demur, Maggie sang her old favorites,
and even though they sounded suspiciously
like &#8220;the goody-goody hymns&#8221; he had heard before,
Skelly sat and listened, keenly appreciative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and see my prize asters, now,&#8221; said
Maggie, turning to lead the way to the Little
Farms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, and Micky, what you think?&#8221; exclaimed
Nelly, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>&#8220;Dutchy Bill what blows de brass horn, won a
prize fer best playin&#8217; dis month!&#8221; said Nelly, delightedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Ikey Einstein, your friend, took the
medal for courage when Bob, the horse, ran
away wid on&#8217;y two little kids in the buckboard.
Ikey jumped out and hung on de horse&#8217;s neck till
Mister Uncle Ben could catch up and help,&#8221; added
Maggie.</p>

<p>&#8220;We raised seven fine hogs for market, boys.
But Mister Uncle Ben bought them from us hisself,
and is going to use &#8217;em in the Blue Bird
and Bobolink Home dis winter, you know,&#8221;
laughed Nelly, eagerly.</p>

<p>So the four rattled on, telling great bits of
news&mdash;at least it was great for Little Citizens&mdash;and
finally they reached the garden plots.</p>

<p>Micky and Skelly were surprised at seeing all
the fine vegetables and flowers growing in each
square, and when Nelly told them of string beans,
radishes, lettuce, and other produce that the children
had gathered and sold to the housekeeper at
Happy Hills, the two city boys began to see how
profitable and pleasant a life on a farm must be.
Ten times more profitable than selling papers!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>Maggie&#8217;s pet aster was admired to her heart&#8217;s
content, but when Skelly bent down to sniff at it,
that he might please Maggie by praising its perfume,
he could not truthfully say a word in its
defence.</p>

<p>Maggie laughed merrily. &#8220;You don&#8217;t like de
smell, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hully chee, Maggie! I t&#8217;hot it was sweet like
roses, but it&#8217;s just like medicine smell!&#8221; said
Skelly.</p>

<p>A few Police sauntered up, eager to be introduced
to the two strangers, and because the newcomers
were a year older than the other boys at
camp, they were shown about with much pride.</p>

<p>The Fire House and apparatus were displayed
and admired, then the base-ball diamond and the
team that was practicing for a match game
against the Police Team was visited.</p>

<p>After this, the pigs had to be exhibited, and
the Street Cleaning Squads were interviewed.
By the time Micky and Skelly had met the Health
Board, and the many other Squads and Boards
formed that summer, they had met every Little
Citizen at Camp, for everyone was a member
of one or more organizations.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>Miss Martin was very pleasant to the
strangers and took them to the Refectory for
some refreshments although it was not suppertime
and dinner was long past. Later they were
shown the Nest they might occupy for their visit,
and when Skelly was removing his shoes that
night preparatory to retiring, he whispered to
Micky:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Mick! Ain&#8217;t dis a place, dough! Wish
to goodness we had come out here sooner and
stayed longer, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine, all right, but yeh see, ef we hed been
here and tooken up the place fer two sickly boys,
it wouldn&#8217;t-a been right! We&#8217;se is big and
healthy and didn&#8217;t need country-life like some of
dem poor little kids we saw coming away from
Noo York dat day in summer,&#8221; replied Micky,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The next day was the Saturday preceding Labor
Day and on the following Tuesday, the Camp
would close at Happy Hills and all the Little Citizens
were to be taken back to the city: some to
take up a residence in the new home, and some
to join their families or friends again, after a
long, wholesome summer in the country.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>That morning after Miss Martin&#8217;s usual story-hour,
Uncle Ben stood up to address the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our New Home, thanks to the efforts of Mr.
Richards and others, is now ready to receive all
those who will belong to our family this winter.
Those who hold passports for this privilege will
stand over to my left side.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a short time a crowd of boys and girls had
grouped themselves as directed. Then the
speaker continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I have some good news to offer the
others. One of the visitors who was present at
our circus saw a great need for a good home for
other children than those who had some talent to
develop, and she went to work and secured the
large house adjoining our home. This she has
renovated and turned into a lodging-house for
those boys and girls who earn a living, or for
those who do not wish to live separate from their
brothers or sisters. For a small weekly fee, a
Little Citizen can live comfortably and well in the
next-door house to our home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I wish to know if there are any present
who would like to engage a room with board at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
this house, so we can tell how many to provide
for on the day we all go back to the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hully chee! What wouldn&#8217;t I give to be
a Little Citizen right now!&#8221; sighed Skelly, while
Micky looked wistful, too.</p>

<p>Bill overheard the remark and a thought came
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Mister Uncle Ben! Can&#8217;t anyone like
an outsider what is workin&#8217; fer his livin&#8217; join dis
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The new house is open for anyone who can
pass a satisfactory examination by the Board.
Of course, you all know we have to question
every applicant so as to keep out bad characters.
Any honest, respectable boy can secure a home
at this house.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that Micky and Skelly exchanged looks, and
Ikey Einstein ran over to join them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz! Boys le&#8217;s join quick! What a
fine home we will have next to Mister Uncle
Ben&#8217;s place!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Martin laughed as she heard the cause
for rejoicing and called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be because you live next to Uncle
Ben, but because you will be half of his family,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
as he will not leave you without his company once
we are settled down for the winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>A score of boys had started towards Uncle Ben
to sign an application for a home, when Micky
and Skelly followed close upon Ikey&#8217;s heels to
secure permission to live in such a heavenly place
as Ikey described it to be.</p>

<p>While they were waiting in line to sign, or
place a mark after their applications, Ikey whispered
to his chums:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Marting said dey got a music-box and
lots of good records fer de boys to play. Dey
got a tank in de cellar fer us to swim in, and a
big back room what is made over into a gym.
And every feller&#8217;s got a bed and burear fer himself.
He can lock de drawers, too, and ef he
wants to be alone, he kin pull his curtains about
his room and shet himself away from de udders!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess ye&#8217;re talkin&#8217; about de swell home fer
de gurls and talents, ain&#8217;t cher?&#8221; remarked
Skelly, skeptically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw! <i>Dey</i> got <i>real</i> rooms fer demselves!
Little square ones all fixed up fine! And downstairs
in de big living room is a <i>real</i> piano fer
music makers. And all sorts of new-fangled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
things fer good times. Oh, dat Blue Bird and
Bobolink City Home is one grand place, I kin
tell yuh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who tol&#8217; you all about it?&#8221; queried Micky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maggie, what is called &#8216;Margaret&#8217; by the
grown-ups!&#8221; bragged Ikey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as fur as I care, de camp kin shet down
now and start us all back to dat city home. I
never had a home, es I kin remember, in all my
life!&#8221; said Skelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your turn next, Skelly,&#8221; called Uncle Ben
at this moment, and the two city boys quickly
went up and signed their names on the register.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will be there Tuesday without fail?&#8221;
asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, we will, Mister Uncle Ben!&#8221; declared
the newsboys.</p>

<p>And so they were. Not only were they eagerly
welcomed to the first good home they had ever
known, but the &#8220;Little Wonders&#8221; found at Happy
Hills were welcomed to <i>their</i> &#8220;Blue Birds&#8217; City
Nest&#8221; where many interesting and wonderful
things came to pass that year, all about which
will be told to you in the next book, entitled &#8220;Blue
Birds&#8217; City Nest.&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
